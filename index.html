          Introduction
       The common concept of sovereignty in international affairs is not a neutral or benign organizing principle. Rather, it is historically based in colonialism and continues to perpetrate systemic racism and structural violence against Indigenous populations globally. As Meghana Nayak and Eric Selbin explain, “lurking behind our passports and citizenship status is the native – the denial, murder, and enslavement of whom made possible the modern nation-state” (Nayak and Selbin 2010: 25). This sharp judgment highlights the basic conflict in International Relations theory’s approach of sovereignty. While IR experts date contemporary sovereignty to the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, presenting it as coming from diplomatic agreement among civilized European powers, this genesis story conceals sovereignty’s underlying foundation in the systematic brutality against Indigenous peoples. The documents that grant us citizenship, the borders that define our states, and the institutions that control international relations all rest upon what Nayak and Selbin characterize as the ‘denial’ of Indigenous political presence. Contemporary IR theory has institutionalized this denial, treating the nation-state system as universal while declaring Indigenous sovereignties invisible or illegitimate. To expose these foundational violences, this essay employs a decolonial methodology that questions the epistemic assumptions underlying standard IR theory. As Erick Viramontes argues, “Decolonizing knowledge entails, in general terms, resisting the underlying criteria of modernity/coloniality for assessing the value of knowledge, while promoting, through institutional designs, a true dialog among knowledges” (Viramontes 2022: 47). This method demonstrates how IR’s adherence to allegedly universal ideas like sovereignty actually reproduces what Viramontes characterizes as the “hierarchy of knowledge” that promotes Western ways of understanding politics while marginalizing Indigenous political thought (Viramontes 2022: 46). Rather than considering Indigenous resistance as a deviation from appropriate governance, a decolonial lens views Indigenous political practices as viable alternatives that expose sovereignty’s colonial origins. This essay advances three interconnected arguments: first, that conventional sovereignty is fundamentally colonial and perpetuates systemic violence against Indigenous peoples; second, that Indigenous resistance constitutes an ongoing response to the violence embedded within the liberal international order; and third, that Indigenous sovereignties offer legitimate alternatives that challenge IR theory’s colonial assumptions. Through this decolonial perspective, Indigenous survival and resistance emerge not as hurdles to international order, but as vital interventions that disclose sovereignty’s actual nature as a tool of racial oppression.
  Historical Foundations of Colonial Sovereignty
      The popular story that sovereignty evolved from calm diplomatic agreement at Westphalia intentionally hides sovereignty’s purpose as a technology of racial control that demands the constant destruction of Indigenous political authority. This concealment is not theoretical carelessness but structural necessity, sovereignty’s legitimacy rests on disguising its colonial underpinnings and presenting continuous violence against Indigenous peoples as justifiable law enforcement rather than systematic extermination. Sovereignty’s colonial logic was established in 1492 when Christopher Columbus encountered the Taíno people and immediately declared: “They should be good and intelligent servants, for I see that they say very quickly everything that is said to them; and I believe that they would become Christians very easily, for it seemed to me that they had no
