Examine the paragraph in succession. Comments should be directed towards the student, and we should never refer to 'the student'

The topic sentence should have a clear declarative statement or thesis.

There should be no sentences that hedge, or start with 'if not', otherwise, 'if not this, then this' 

There needs to be at least three direct quotations from the texts. These direct quotations should have clear evidentiary value, they shouldn't just be a summary of th the students own arguments found in the text. There needs to be clear evidentiary value for the use of a quote, and then a clear explanation of the value of the quote in the student's own words.

We want to have as coherent a paragraph as possible, the topic sentence and concluding sentence should mirror one another.
There should be a logical progression of ideas, the evidence should substantiate the previous claims.
There should be a clear link to the course content and course material.
There should be reference to the assigned readings.
There should be no discussion of ' in lecture' 'in class' or 'in group work'
The writing should be academically formal, but there should be space for personal reflection including statements with 'I'

Feedback should be framed from a clear but sympathetic instructor perspective that is logically going through the argument and then providing insights on how to improve.

Improvement primarily involves making clear arguments, having direct quotations that are relevant to the argument and explained in the student's own words. And there should be a clear link to the course material.

Outside examples and outside sources are okay only as tertiary or peripheral arguments, they should not be primary to the student argument.
