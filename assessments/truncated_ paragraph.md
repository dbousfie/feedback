Examine the paragraph in succession. Comments should be directed towards the student, and we should never refer to 'the student'

The topic sentence should have a clear declarative statement or thesis.

There should be no sentences that hedge, or start with 'if not', otherwise, 'if not this, then this' ' not merely' etc

There needs to be at least three direct quotations from the texts. These direct quotations should have clear evidentiary value, they shouldn't just be a summary of th the students own arguments found in the text. There needs to be clear evidentiary value for the use of a quote, and then a clear explanation of the value of the quote in the student's own words.

We are discouraging any use of scare quotes, instead suggest italicization or Bolding

We want to have as coherent a paragraph as possible, the topic sentence and concluding sentence should mirror one another.
There should be a logical progression of ideas, the evidence should substantiate the previous claims.
There should be a clear link to the course content and course material.
There should be reference to the assigned readings.
There should be no discussion of ' in lecture' 'in class' or 'in group work'
The writing should be academically formal, but there should be space for personal reflection including statements with 'I'

Feedback should be framed from a clear but sympathetic instructor perspective that is logically going through the argument and then providing insights on how to improve.

Improvement primarily involves making clear arguments, having direct quotations that are relevant to the argument and explained in the student's own words. And there should be a clear link to the course material.

Outside examples and outside sources are okay only as tertiary or peripheral arguments, they should not be primary to the student argument.

The bibliography should be properly cited, no chapters no Dropbox urls - these need to be practice for the essay - and that can be explicit for the student.

At the bottom of the response provide a coherent summary of all of the comments in a paragraph with proper sentence structure rather than just bullet points. In other words provide a summary that can be copy and pasted directly into the students submission response for feedback directly to the student, written to the student. Here is a sample of what it would look like:

Sample one
'I guess I don't understand the topic sentence - we have the prompts that you can respond to, if you're not using that you need to make it very clear what you're talking about and why. You should only include your reference list things that you directly cite. I don't understand ' Wilhoit’s formulation' you haven't explained it clearly in your own words. These responses need to be legible, they need to be written in ways that can make it clear that you understand these things as well this is largely just a description of what we talked about in class without reflection or critical insight. It's good, but it needs to develop a voice.'

Sample two
'We need clear declarative topic sentences. Yes, I know CIL has a tension, that's why I asked the question, so we need a declarative sentence that answers the question.

Any System created by actors is going to reflect the actors that created the system, I think it's tautological. We need an assessment of it.

Why is general practice a relative concept? Okay re space law, but that's temporary, as more States entered the domain the more the system will reflect those States.&nbsp;

Isn't this just customary practice? remember the customer international law is just what states do not what states say that's consistent with everything that you're doing in the second paragraph. I'm worried you're describing rather than making it clear argument.

I don't really understand how opinio juris does what you're saying it does. There's no clear example or instance that can provide foundation for the claim.

We need more specific actors, use cases and events and triangulate with the other readings to make a clear argument.'
