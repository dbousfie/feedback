Western University is situated on the traditional territories of the
Anishinaabeg, Haudenosaunee, Lunaapeewak and Attawandaron peoples, who
have longstanding relationships to the land and region of southwestern
Ontario and the City of London. The local First Nation communities of
this area include Chippewas of the Thames First Nation, Oneida Nation of
the Thames, and Munsee Delaware Nation. In the region, there are eleven
First Nation communities and a growing Indigenous urban population.
Western values the significant historical and contemporary contributions
of local and regional First Nations and all of the Original peoples of
Turtle Island (North America).

**Introduction:**

This course will help you critically assess the political perspectives
on contemporary issues on the United Nations and global governance. This
course will help you explore the theoretical perspectives on the United
Nations, as well as key issues, debates and topics in global governance.
We will address a range of issues starting with the UN's objectives,
structure and decision-making procedures, followed by United Nations\'
policies and activities on a range of contemporary issues, including
peacekeeping, peace building, humanitarian intervention, economic
development, and human rights.

**Learning Objectives:**

Through this course all students will have the opportunity to:

• Identify the implicit messages and goals of public documents and media
relating to a United Nations issue

• Evaluate a popular depiction of the United Nations policy or issue

• Acquire a historical context of existing United Nations policy and
actions

• Identify key issues in contemporary UN policies and apply a critical
framework to assess the effectiveness of policy decisions

Through this course some students will have the opportunity to:

• Evaluate the effectiveness of mainstream accounts of the functioning
of the United Nations

## For all written work in this course: 

## Paragraph structure 

Basic paragraph structure is an important part of writing. Failure to
use basic paragraph structure will result in repetitive, unstructured,
illogical arguments. Paragraphs help to structure our thought, our
ability to make claims and provide a framework for writing. The topic
sentence and concluding sentence of each paragraph should be in your own
voice (no direct references, quotations or citations). A basic paragraph
structure should follow this template:

- Topic/introduction, in one or two sentences

- Major point with evidence one or two sentences (one sentence with
  academic citation and one sentence explaining the relevance in your
  own words)

- Major point with evidence one or two sentences (one sentence with
  academic citation and one sentence explaining the relevance in your
  own words)

- Major point with evidence one or two sentences (one sentence with
  academic citation and one sentence explaining the relevance in your
  own words)

- Summarizing sentence of overall significance to the overarching thesis
  of the paper and

- Concluding sentence which restates topic sentence and bridges to next
  paragraph.

Failure to use basic paragraph structure throughout your work will
result in the inability to receive full marks.

These paragraph formatting requirements are not arbitrary. There is a
specific reason that I want you to use peer-reviewed academic sources, a
MINIMUM of THREE DIFFERENT ACADEMIC SOURCES per paragraph. WHY?

- First, the difference between opinion and argument is the provision of
  evidence.

- Second, for an academic argument to have veracity, it needs to have an
  arm\'s length perspective, it needs to draw on peer-reviewed sources
  because individual interpretation is prone to error.

- Next, if we have more than one academic source per paragraph if one of
  those sources is weak or questionable the other two will supplement
  it.

- Moreover, multiple sources prevent summary or representation of
  someone else\'s ideas as your own, if you must interpret multiple data
  sources.

- Finally, academic sources have explanatory frameworks that link them
  to underlying theoretical concepts and ideas. News sources, data
  points, and journalism provide evidence without analysis, academic
  work provides analysis with evidence. If you don\'t have that
  consistently throughout your writing, you are going to run into
  problems of the veracity of your claims because they lack
  substantiation.

If any of your sentences, paragraphs or quotations lack specific
foundation, you will not receive grades for those submissions.

Lack of data is a lack of foundation: In the era of LLMs, inaccurate
citations will be treated as no citation at all. LLMs routinely
summarize sources, without accessing the underlying data. *A failure to
directly quote sources with quotation marks followed by an explanation
in your own words will constitute a lack of sufficient citation.
Paraphrasing is no longer a sufficient justification for including a
citation*, you must use specific and precise language including nouns
(specific people, places and things) as generalized summaries of sources
are often hallucinated, inaccurate and incomplete when suggested by
LLMs.

## General information about missed coursework

Students must familiarize themselves with the *University Policy on
Academic Consideration -- Undergraduate Students in First Entry
Programs* posted on the Academic Calendar:

<https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/academic_consideration_Sep24.pdf>,

This policy does not apply to requests for Academic Consideration
submitted for **attempted or completed work**, whether online or in
person.

The policy also does not apply to students experiencing longer-term
impacts on their academic responsibilities. These students should
consult [Accessible
Education](http://academicsupport.uwo.ca/accessible_education/).

For procedures on how to submit Academic Consideration requests, please
see the information posted on the Office of the Registrar's webpage:

<https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/>

All requests for Academic Consideration must be made within 48 hours
after the assessment date or submission deadline.

All Academic Consideration requests must include supporting
documentation; however, recognizing that formal documentation may not be
available in some extenuating circumstances, the policy allows students
to make [one]{.underline} Academic Consideration request **without
supporting documentation** in this course. However, the following
assessments are excluded from this, and therefore always require formal
supporting documentation:

Media Assignment/Background Presentation

When a student *[mistakenly]{.underline}* submits their
[one]{.underline} allowed Academic Consideration request **without
supporting documentation** for the assessments listed above or those in
the **Coursework with Assessment Flexibility** section below, [the
request cannot be recalled and reapplied]{.underline}. This privilege is
forfeited.

Coursework with Assessment Flexibility

By policy, instructors may deny Academic Consideration requests for the
following assessments with built-in flexibility

Flexible Completion assignments:

Weekly participation. This course has 12 weekly participation
assignments, and the 10 quizzes with the highest marks are counted
towards your final grade. Should extenuating circumstances arise,
students do not need to request Academic Consideration for the first 2
missed weekly participations. Academic consideration requests will be
denied for the first 2 missed weekly participation.

Religious Accommodation

When conflicts with a religious holiday that requires an absence from
the University or prohibits certain activities, students should request
an accommodation for their absence in writing to the course instructor
and/or the Academic Advising office of their Faculty of Registration.
This notice should be made as early as possible but not later than two
weeks prior to the writing or the examination (or one week prior to the
writing of the test).

Please visit the Diversity Calendars posted on our university's EDID
website for the recognized religious holidays: https://www.edi.uwo.ca.

Accommodation Policies

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact Accessible
Education, which provides recommendations for accommodation based on
medical documentation or psychological and cognitive testing. The policy
on Academic Accommodation for Students with Disabilities can be found
at: https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/Academic
Accommodation_disabilities.pdf.

Academic Policies- The website for Registrar Services is
https://www.registrar.uwo.ca/.

In accordance with policy,
https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/policies_procedures/section1/mapp113.pdf

the centrally administered e-mail account provided to students will be
considered the individual's official university e-mail address. It is
the responsibility of the account holder to ensure that e-mail received
from the University at their official university address is attended to
in a timely manner.

Scholastic offences are taken seriously and students are directed to
read the appropriate policy, specifically, the definition of what
constitutes a Scholastic Offence, at the following Web site:

https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/scholastic_discipline_undergrad.pdf.

All required papers may be subject to submission for textual similarity
review to the commercial plagiarism detection software under license to
the University for the detection of plagiarism. All papers submitted for
such checking will be included as source documents in the reference
database for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of papers subsequently
submitted to the system. Use of the service is subject to the licensing
agreement, currently between The University of Western Ontario and
Turnitin.com (<http://www.turnitin.com>).

## Weekly Participation -- (Weekly submissions) 

Weekly Assignments -- Base submission is pass/fail 70% (17.5 of 25)

Students **must** complete a minimum of **two engagement options weekly
to** fulfill participation requirements. You can choose to do 250-word
paragraph responses each week, but they need to follow the requirements
outlined in this syllabus. Other written forms of participation can only
be done twice each during the entire course (i.e. you can only do 2
policy briefs summaries per semester). You can collaborate with peers on
submissions, but they must be submitted individually. A **total of 8
weeks of participation is required,** allowing students to skip 4 weeks
(e.g., weeks 1,2 and 11, 12). Completing 8 weeks fulfills the full 70%.
If you are submitting the same assignment for a second time, make sure
to address 'What did I do differently this week?'

Weekly Engagement Options:

> In-class exercises count as one form of participation.\
> For the secondary form of participation, these are available options:

1.  Written Responses (250 words per lesson): A reflective analysis
    engaging with lesson ideas and concepts from lectures, readings, or
    both. This is not a summary but a critical engagement that links
    material to current international issues. Proper essay paragraph
    structure and intext citations are required where applicable. You
    must reference the course readings at least three times per week to
    get maximum grades. Submissions not meeting these standards are
    ineligible for full credit. Each written response counts for one
    participation mark. See detailed criteria below.

2.  Video Responses: A short (TikTok-style) video exploring a key
    academic issue from each lesson's content, suitable for a general
    audience. Videos must reference at least one academic, peer-reviewed
    source from our reading list and can be uploaded to Brightspace each
    week (or linked if hosted elsewhere). Public posting is not
    required. Each video counts for one participation mark.

3.  **Infographic -** For the infographic option, students must produce
    a visually compelling and clearly organized visual argument that
    shows critical engagement with this week's material. The infographic
    should draw directly on at least two course readings, including
    direct quotations that are embedded meaningfully in the visual
    narrative. It must reflect current debates in Canada, using events
    or policy developments from the past few weeks to make clear why the
    material matters now. The assignment should not just present
    information but take a position, expose a contradiction, or offer a
    critique based on the themes of the week. A bibliography in proper
    citation format must be included at the bottom or on a final panel.

> Sample weekly participation submission:![Picture 565367195, Picture,
> Picture](media/image1.png){width="4.989583333333333in"
> height="1.78125in"}

A Final calculation activity is **required** to receive your
participation mark.

Beyond the two forms of participation each week, substantive improvement
can result in a higher grade. I withhold the right to assess the quality
of the submission and adjust the grade accordingly). You should be able
to demonstrate your responses to my feedback, engaging with different
course material each week to demonstrate improvement throughout the
course.

Calculating participation:\
Q: Why do you do it this way? A: We use this structure to reduce
unconscious bias and subjective grading. Participation becomes
transparent and equitable because grades are based on clear, objective
evidence---not attendance, personality, or assumptions. Credit for
submissions require documented improvement and, for written work, direct
citation of weekly readings.

Q: What does it mean to calculate participation? A: Calculating
participation minimizes unconscious bias, groupthink, and subjective
grading. It creates a clear, fair structure for assessment. At the end
of the course, students self-calculate their participation based on what
they submitted each week. We only count your top 10 submissions. If
there are any exceptional circumstances, please document them in your
final attachment summary and explain how they impact your calculation. I
reserve the right to reassess any or all participation during the final
calculation.\
\
Sample calculation\
w1 85 - 'more precise'\
w2 85 - 'more precise'\
w3 85 -- 'too colloquial'\
w4 85 -- 'clarity needed'\
w5 85 - 'concluding bubble missing information'\
w6 0\
w7 85 - 'urls and conclusion need improvement'\
w8 85 'need for direct quotes'\
w9 70\
w10 90 -- 'ok\'\
w11 90- 'ok'\
w12 0\
7 weeks at 85 = 7x85 = 595\
2 weeks at 90 = 180\
1 week at 70 = 70

595+180+70 = 845 = 84.5%

## Attendance Bonus (5% on final participation summary)

Students will receive a 1% bonus on their final participation summary
for every two classes attended (attendance must be recorded through the
Microsoft form each week during class time), with a maximum of 10
classes considered to earn the full 5% bonus. You can check your
participation through the link in Brightspace weekly. You cannot receive
more than 100% on the final participation mark.

## Media Assessment or Background Presentation: 

Option 1: Media Assessment - Sign up will be during week 1 or you
forfeit your grade. This assignment will critically engage with an
official or unofficial depiction of UN action in relation to a specific
case or issue of global governance. All media options must be approved
by the instructor before proceeding with the assignment. Media can
include but is not limited to motion pictures, short films,
documentaries, special reports, and public relations of any UN body,
agency or group. Signup for the media assessment will take place through
the link in Brightspace. The media assessment must critically engage
with the content and argument of the media for its use in understanding
contemporary UN issues. This critical assessment can be presented in 2
ways.

> 1\. A written report (essay) which assesses the media for its
> arguments about the UN issue, and the viability of the arguments given
> the academic debates on the issue. The written assignment should be a
> minimum of 1250 words, in proper essay format (with title page and
> bibliography) and have a minimum of 4 academic sources, primarily from
> course readings. **Due the end of Week 5.**
>
> 2\. An in-class presentation. A section or short part (maximum 5
> minutes) of media should be distributed to the class (subject to
> instructor prior approval and following class guidelines) and the
> presenter should outline their interpretation of the argument for the
> class. The presenter will then prepare a short exercise, role playing
> or creative interactive exercise to raise issues and ideas that stem
> from media and their critical interpretation of it. A minimum of 4
> academic sources are required for the assignment.

For an example of a media assessment see:

Heather L. Johnson \"Click to Donate: Visual images, constructing
victims and imagining the female refugee\" Third World Quarterly, June
2011.

For methodological foundation of media assessments see:

Weber, Cynthia. \"International Relations Theory: A Critical
Introduction.\" (2021).\

University Press, 2011.

http://www.e-ir.info/2015/04/22/edited-collection-popular-culture-and-world-politics/

Option 2: Background Presentations :Sign up will be during week 1 or you
forfeit your grade.

Students will select a chapter from Mingst, Karen A., Margaret P. Karns,
and Alynna J. Lyon. The United Nations in the 21st century. Routledge,
2022 and highlight key issues they found in the chapter assigned for the
week. The chapters are detailed and expansive, so students must choose
key issues or themes of which they were unaware, or that would be useful
in establishing a foundation for class discussion. The student will
prepare a very short (5 minutes maximum) way to highlight the key themes
of the text on an issue related to the theme for the week. THIS IS NOT A
SUMMARY. The goal of the exercise is to raise analytical issues and
concerns with the course material rather than summarize or re-present
the material. All exercises must be preapproved by the instructor and
cannot be presented without the instructor's approval. A minimum of 2
academic sources is required for this submission or full grades cannot
be achieved.

## Presentation 

Option 1: Student Provocations (maximum of 2 per week)

The student provocations are a two-part exercise. During the first class
students will select a week for their provocation. Each student will
find at least one link to an article, issue, newspaper event or magazine
topic and post it for the class at least one week prior to the class in
which they present. Failure to post a reading for the class will make it
impossible to achieve full marks on the assignment. Each student will
prepare a very short (5 minutes maximum) exercise to stimulate class
discussion on an issue related to course. THIS IS NOT A SUMMARY.
Students should prepare a short exercise, role playing or creative
interactive exercise to raise issues and ideas that stem from the
discussion questions or their reading for the week. Students do not
necessarily need to present orally to the class, as long as they provide
clear instructions and facilitate the exercise. The goal of the exercise
is to raise analytical issues and concerns with the course material
rather than summarize or re-present the material. All exercises must be
preapproved by the instructor and cannot be presented without the
instructor's approval. A minimum of 1 academic source is required for
this submission or full grades cannot be achieved.

Option 2: Presentation of Proposed Research (Essay Proposal)

Length: 1000-1250 words (4-5 pages, excluding bibliography and title
page), typed and double spaced.\
Topics: Students choose their own essay topics, but such choices must be
approved by the instructor. The essay proposal must have, as part of its
introduction, a statement of its thesis (central argument). The
assignment must be in proper formal essay format (no bullet points,
short form or colloquial language, can use subheadings to identify
sections, use proper citation and should NOT INCLUDE ANY FORM OF
ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY. Dictionaries, encyclopedias, and Wikipedia
should not be used, and use of web material is subject to instructor's
prior approval. A basic structure for the essay proposal will include:

1\) Title, topic and thesis question or area of interest for potential
research.

2\) One dominant approach to study the issue. The dominant approach will
provide the explanatory foundation of the thesis, more than one approach
can be used, but the primary approach should be linked to the
explanatory assertion of the thesis (i.e. the UNHCR's role in the
Rohingya crisis demonstrates the importance of international legal
mechanisms in constraining state behaviour).

3\) Three key distinct arguments with evidence in support of the thesis.
Remember to follow the paragraph structure in the course outline. The
data should primarily come from course readings, the pre-approved
suggested readings, and suggested texts. Students must engage with at
least three course texts to complete the assignment, and the majority
(51%+) of your academic sources should come from the required and
optional readings in the course outline.

4\) A conclusion that mirrors your title, topic and thesis question. It
is always a good idea to rewrite your introduction after you have
written your conclusion. Your conclusion should provide the clear
foundation that you have established throughout the essay, to
demonstrate the validity of your thesis. Therefore, your thesis and your
conclusion should match one another. Failure to have consistent
argumentation will result in the inability to achieve full grades.

5\) Properly cited research. In text citation is preferred (author date
system, as outlined below in 'guidelines for success in class). There
should be no proxy urls (<https://www.lib.uwo.ca/>) no search urls
(<http://search.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/>) or Dropbox urls
(<https://www.dropbox.com/>). Citations need to be consistently
formatted, readily available, in English, with precise page numbers (no
inclusion of p.23-44, or consistent citation across pages (i.e.
p.118-119). Lack of data is a lack of foundation. In the era of LLMs,
inaccurate citations will be treated as no citation at all. LLMs
routinely summarize sources without accessing the underlying data.
Failure to directly quote sources with quotation marks followed by an
explanation in your own words will constitute a lack of sufficient
citation. Paraphrasing is no longer sufficient justification for
including a citation; **you must use specific and precise language,
including nouns (specific people, places, and things),** as generalized
summaries of sources are often hallucinated, inaccurate, and incomplete
when suggested by LLMs.

6\) A title page with your name, *a title for your paper that reflects
the thesis and topic of your paper*, the date of submission and the
course number on it. If you cannot clearly and simply identify the title
and topic of your paper, it is often an indicator of a lack of focus.

Papers submitted before the deadline can revise and resubmit the
assignment. For details on revision and resubmission see the 'revise and
resubmit' tab in OWL.

## Essay: Due at the end of Week 10 

## Length: 2000 words (8 pages), typed and double spaced. Pages should be numbered, and the type of font should be no smaller than 12 characters per inch (e.g., Arial 12). Students must submit their papers through the assignment tab in OWL and all papers may be processed by Turnitin. The instructor may require that 10% of randomly selected students will have to meet to discuss their paper after completion to ensure there has been no improper LLM use.

Topics: Students choose their own essay topics, but such choices must be
approved by the instructor. The essay must have, as part of its
introduction, a statement of its thesis (central argument). This thesis
must be supported by a careful analysis of relevant data and arguments
in the body of the paper. The assignment must be in proper formal essay
format (no bullet points, short form or colloquial language, can use
subheadings to identify sections, use proper citation and should NOT
INCLUDE ANY FORM OF ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY. Dictionaries, encyclopedias,
and Wikipedia should not be used, and use of web material is subject to
instructor's prior approval. A basic structure for the essay will
include:

1\) Title, topic and thesis question or area of interest for potential
research.

4\) A conclusion that mirrors your title, topic and thesis question. It
is always a good idea to rewrite your introduction after you have
written your conclusion. Your conclusion should provide the clear
foundation that you have established throughout the essay, to
demonstrate the validity of your thesis. Therefore, your thesis and your
conclusion should match one another. Failure to have consistent
argumentation will result in the inability to achieve full grades.

5\) Properly cited research. In text citation is preferred (author date
system, as outlined below in 'guidelines for success in class). There
should be no proxy urls (<https://www.lib.uwo.ca/>) no search urls
(<http://search.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/>) or Dropbox urls
(<https://www.dropbox.com/>). Citations need to be consistently
formatted, readily available, in English, with precise page numbers (no
inclusion of p.23-44, or consistent citation across pages (i.e.
p.118-119). Lack of data is a lack of foundation. In the era of LLMs,
inaccurate citations will be treated as no citation at all. LLMs
routinely summarize sources without accessing the underlying data.
Failure to directly quote sources with quotation marks followed by an
explanation in your own words will constitute a lack of sufficient
citation. Paraphrasing is no longer sufficient justification for
including a citation; **you must use specific and precise language,
including nouns (specific people, places, and things),** as generalized
summaries of sources are often hallucinated, inaccurate, and incomplete
when suggested by LLMs.

6\) A title page with your name, *a title for your paper that reflects
the thesis and topic of your paper*, the date of submission and the
course number on it. If you cannot clearly and simply identify the title
and topic of your paper, it is often an indicator of a lack of focus.

Papers submitted before the deadline can revise and resubmit the
assignment. For details on revision and resubmission see the 'revise and
resubmit' tab in OWL.

## Zoom Etiquette

1.  Please pay attention to video, microphone and screensharing
    settings. Keep chat rooms and images appropriate for an academic
    setting. Any inappropriate actions, imagery, discussion or chat
    messages may result in your removal from the meeting at my
    discretion. Audio recordings may be available as an alternative to
    synchronous discussion.

2.  Please test all WIFI, video and audio before the meetings. Zoom
    buttons for raising your hand, responding yes and no, asking host to
    adjust speed, requesting a break and more.

3.  Please be conscious of your speaking time and that of others, if you
    are continuing in a manner that is not fair to your peers, I reserve
    the right to intervene and put us back on a more focused discussion.

## Recording synchronous content (office hours or other meetings)

All Zoom meetings (including office hours) for this course **may** be
recorded. The data captured during these recordings may include your
image, voice recordings, chat logs and personal identifiers (name
displayed on the screen). The recordings may be used for educational
purposes related to this course, including evaluations and assisting
with preparation of your assignments (you can request a copy of the
meeting). The recordings may be disclosed to other individuals
participating in the course for their private or group study purposes.
Please contact the instructor if you have any concerns related to
session recordings. Participants in this course are not permitted to
record the sessions, except where recording is an approved
accommodation, or the participant has the prior written permission of
the instructor.

Notes: The Department's rules regarding plagiarism and the submission of
similar essays to two or more different instructors are appended to this
course outline and should be noted. (See 'Criteria for Evaluation of
Written Assignments' below).

Guidelines for Success in Class

Since there seldom are definitive answers to the questions we will be
asking about UN issues, and much of what you will learn in this course
will be enhanced by the ideas and perspectives of your colleagues. But
for this to work, everyone must participate fully and constructively. Be
mindful of the following points, and you will be successful:

> • Come to all classes having read the assigned readings for that week
> and prepared to participate in discussion. It is useful to remember
> that some week's readings may be more relevant to your research
> interests than others, and focusing on readings that are most salient
> to your interests will ensure maximum usefulness in the course.
>
> • Participate in discussions, but do not over-participate. Everyone
> must be given an opportunity to take part in discussions. Constructive
> participation involves the raising of relevant points and ideas.
> Online participation will be considered as well in participation
> marks.
>
> • Demonstrate respect for the ideas presented by others at all times.
> This is essential to open discussion and the free exchange of ideas.
> This does not mean that you must agree with others. Informal debate
> will teach you even more about your own position while simultaneously
> exposing you to different viewpoints. Make use of such opportunities,
> but no disrespectful behavior will be tolerated.
>
> • Raise questions when you have them. Raising useful questions counts
> as participation. You can use minute papers, online forums, e-mail,
> facebook or in class lecture to raise questions you encounter
> throughout the course. Uncertainties are usually shared by others --
> when you raise your questions in class everyone learns while you build
> your own participation grade.

## Criteria for Evaluation of Written Assignments 

These criteria will be used in evaluation of written work and possibly
in combination with the checklist below. Please be sure to read them
carefully:

## Formatting

All work should be double spaced using 12 point font (even on policy
briefs). Page numbers should always be included . Never use bullet
points anywhere -- they condense ideas when I need to see the logic and
academic argumentation that underpin your claims.

## Quotations

Quotations longer than 4 lines should be indented. Try to avoid
quotations longer than 4 lines. Assume that I do not read an indented
4line quotation and make sure the sentence immediately following the
quotation summarizes its significance to your argument in your own
words. Never include quotations or sources in your introduction or
conclusion, your introduction and conclusion should outline the paper
structure in your own words.

## Citations and Bibliography (modified Harvard)

We will use the author date system. It keeps footnotes and endnotes to a
minimum.

- Text references will be short with the Surname, Date and page number
  (i.e. Žižek 2002: 342).

- Use this formatting everywhere, including sources from our reading
  list and in the response papers and any written work.

- Works by the same author in the same year should be cited as Žižek
  2002a, Žižek2002b, etc.

- Et al. can be used by sources with three or more authors. The full
  list must be in the bibliography.

- If you have more than one source in the same sentence you just include
  them with a semi-colon in chronological order i.e (Žižek 2002: 345;
  D'Amelio 2018: 212; Swift 2020: 445)

## Bibliography 

> A bibliography must be included in all written work, it should include
> the complete details of the work and included an 'Accessed' date if it
> is an online source.

**Analytical Content: Higher** grades will be given to work that
demonstrates the ability to interpret, critically assess and develop
insights of the material. To determine whether or not your argument is
analytical, ask yourself \"Am I demonstrating to the reader my insights
in an academic way?" If you are simply summarizing or describing in
detail phenomena, your work is unlikely to have high analytical content.

> Helpful signs you are not developing analytical content: Excessive
> quotes; beginning or ending a paragraph with a quote; short (fewer
> than 4 sentences) paragraphs; no sources in a long paragraph; lack of
> similar argument in introduction and conclusion.

**Development of an Argument: Higher** grades will be given to work that
has a clearly stated argument and a set of logically developed and
reasonably comprehensive points in support of that argument. Academic
arguments need not be personal (though in certain instances they can be
-- check with the instructor), rather they demonstrate the logical
progression of the position you are developing. The key here is to
attempt to convince your reader of the soundness or feasibility of your
argument. Nuanced arguments recognize obvious criticisms and seek to
address them logically. Consistency of an argument throughout a paper is
important.

> Helpful signs your argument may be in trouble: Using the same author
> or quote more than a few times in successive paragraphs; your
> introduction and conclusion are not similar; you introduce material in
> the introduction and the conclusion that cannot be found elsewhere;
> you have quotes in your conclusion; your attempt to address obvious
> criticisms contradicts your thesis, you adopt multiple theoretical
> frameworks; you cannot find any sources that agree with your central
> claims.

**Grammar, Spelling, and Style:** Higher grades will be given to written
work that is grammatically correct and is clearly and accurately
written, while lower grades will be given to work that is difficult to
read or understand due to excessive grammatical and/or spelling errors.

While different approaches work for different people, it is recommended
that you try the following every time you have a written assignment:
after completing your assignment, put it away for a while (ideally, for
a few days); when you pick it up again, read it carefully, slowly, and
aloud (when we are familiar with a paper we tend to skim it during
proof-reading, thereby missing errors -- so make sure you are reading it
word for word). Mistakes in grammar may not always look wrong, but they
usually sound wrong. If you need some help with writing style or
grammar, there are many resources available on campus.

**Meeting the Requirements of the Assignment:** All written work must be
submitted on time, must be of the appropriate length, must use the
required number and type of resources, and, most importantly, must
address the issues or questions posed in the assignment.

## Revise and resubmit

## Everyone in all of my third and fourth year courses has one \'revise and resubmit\' on every written assignment. I do this as practice because that\'s how my papers and chapters are reviewed by editors, and it\'s a primary value of the university experience, editing and revising.

## Written assignments in this course are able to be revised and resubmitted once and once only.

## If you want to use this as a draft option, you can hand in your written assignment early.

## In most cases, you will want to revise and resubmit the substantial assignments first, such as an essay.

## For students submitting on time: I follow a first-in-first-out essay submission system. If you submit your essay on time I will aspire to have it back as soon as possible, so you can revise and resubmit it as soon as possible.

##  For students submitting with an approved extension: it\'s less likely that you will get the essay back in time to revise it. Please keep that in mind. 

## Resubmission rules

##  1. Resubmissions can only result in a higher grade, as long as you track changes. **You must track changes.** If you do not track changes I will have to remark your paper from scratch and your grade is no longer guaranteed to improve. We use the online version of Word - we can track changes with \--\'review\'-\> \'track changes\'\--\> \'track changes for everyone\'

##  2. You **must include a grade goal** for your revised paper. The grade goal lets me assess the extent to which you have taken my comments and feedback and made sufficient changes to achieve your grade goal.

##  3. **You will not receive a second set of comments** on the revisions only a revised grade. This is standard practice in publishing as well (revisions are sufficient and they publish or revisions are insufficient and they reject).

##  4. All resubmissions must be submitted before you write your exam for the course.

**Statement on Academic Offences**

Scholastic offences are taken seriously and students are directed to
read the appropriate policy, specifically, the definition of what
constitutes a Scholastic Offence, at the following Web site:
http://www.uwo.ca/univsec/handbook/appeals/scholastic_discipline_undergrad.pdf
.

"All required papers **may** be subject to submission for textual
similarity review to the commercial plagiarism detection software under
license to the University for the detection of plagiarism. All papers
submitted for such checking will be included as source documents in the
reference database for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of papers
subsequently submitted to the system. Use of the service is subject to
the licensing agreement, currently between The University of Western
Ontario and Turnitin.com (http://www.turnitin.com)."

**Important Notices**

# General

All students must complete all course requirements. Failure to do so
(e.g., by not handing-in an assignment or by missing an examination
without due cause) will subject the student to the appropriate
University regulations. Students must also keep a duplicate copy of
their assignments.

## Policy on communication

The forums should be your primary place for questions, issues and
concerns with the course. I strive to be accessible and responsive to
student inquiries. However, repeated or persistent e-mails/texts/phone
calls will overload my capacity to respond to all students equally. As
such, I reserve the right to answer initial questions but forego
multiple responses or inquires for a 24hour cool-down period. I
appreciate your understanding in this matter.

## Late Assignments - Formal Guidelines

Late papers will be accepted but will be subject to a late penalty of 10
per cent per day to a maximum of 5 days, after which they will not be
accepted and a mark of 0 will be recorded. In the interest of fairness
to all students, there will be no exceptions to this unless you have
arranged in advance for an extension. All extensions must be arranged in
advance of the day on which a paper is due**. Papers submitted after
deadlines (including excused late papers) will be marked, but comments
will not be** **provided.**

## Policy on Children in the classroom[^1] 

"It is my belief that if we want women in academia, that we should also
expect children to be present in some form. Currently, the university
does not have a formal policy on children in the classroom. The policy
described here is thus, a reflection of my own beliefs and commitments
to student, staff and faculty parents.

All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as is
necessary to support the breastfeeding relationship. Because not all
women can pump sufficient milk, and not all babies will take a bottle
reliably, I never want students to feel like they have to choose between
feeding their baby and continuing their education. You and your nursing
baby are welcome in class anytime.

For older children and babies, I understand that minor illnesses and
unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of
having to chose between missing class to stay home with a child and
leaving him or her with someone you or the child does not feel
comfortable with. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare
solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps
in care is perfectly acceptable.

I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment
that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in
parenting status.

In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit
close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and
is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until
their need has been met. Non-parents in the class, please reserve seats
near the door for your parenting classmates.

Finally, I understand that often the largest barrier to completing your
coursework once you become a parent is the tiredness many parents feel
in the evening once children have finally gone to sleep. The struggles
of balancing school, childcare and often another job are exhausting! I
hope that you will feel comfortable disclosing your student-parent
status to me. This is the first step in my being able to accommodate any
special needs that arise. While I maintain the same high expectations
for all student in my classes regardless of parenting status, I am happy
to problem solve with you in a way that makes you feel supported as you
strive for school-parenting balance. Thank you for the diversity you
bring to our classroom!"

## Policy on non-service animals in the classroom 

Western University established a [Pets and Therapy Animals policy in May
2020](https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/policies_procedures/section1/mapp156.pdf)
that limits the presence of pets in campus buildings. Service and
therapy animals are permitted inside all Western locations, in
accordance with accessibility policies, however animals for
companionship are not allowed.

## Religious/Cultural Observance 

Persons who have religious or cultural observances that coincide with
this class should let the instructor know in writing (by e-mail for
example) by Week 4. I strongly encourage you to honor your cultural and
religious holidays! However, if I do not hear from you by Week 4, I will
assume that you plan to attend all class meetings.

## Point of View

The readings, class lectures, and my comments in class will suggest a
particular point of view. This perspective is my own and does not have
to be yours! I encourage you to disagree with the ideas in the readings
and lectures as well as the perspectives of your colleagues in the
course. Please express yourself! A significant part of a university
education is learning about the complexity of various issues; therefore,
it is important that we listen and respect one another but we do not
have to agree. A richer discussion will occur when a variety of
perspectives are presented in class for discussion.

## Discussion Guidelines[^2]

In our structured and unstructured discussions and dialogues, we also
will have many opportunities to explore some challenging, high-stakes
issues and increase our understandings of different perspectives. Our
conversations may not always be easy; we sometimes will make mistakes in
our speaking and our listening; sometimes we will need patience or
courage or imagination or any number of qualities in combination to
engage our texts, our classmates, and our own ideas and experiences.
Always we will need respect for others. Thus, an important secondary aim
of our course necessarily will be for us to increase our facility with
the sometimes-difficult conversations that arise inside issues of social
inequality as we deepen our understandings of multiple perspectives --
whatever our backgrounds, experiences, or positions.

## Policy on the use of LLMs (AI, ChatGPT, Bard, etc) in the classroom[^3][^4]

Unless otherwise noted during class activities, you may only use ChatGPT
or any other Generative technology to *aid* or *nuance* your thinking,
communication, and learning; but not to *replace* or *subvert* it. See
the table below for some examples of allowable and non-allowable uses of
Generative technology in this class (NOTE: This is not an exhaustive
list of examples). Generative technology may be used to assist in
assessment throughout the course, if you wish to opt out of the use of
generative technology, please let me know.

How generative technology may be used in assessment:

1\. Pre-assessment - to provide structural or overall feedback before I
begin any grading.

2\. Applying rubric - using the rubric from the course outline to apply
to submitted assignments to assess the degree of compliance before or
during I complete any grading.

3\. During assessment - to double-check the veracity of claims made
about your submission during my assessment of your material.

4\. Post assessment - to find additional examples or instances in your
submissions to assist in my feedback.

5\. Refining assessment - suggesting forms of constructive criticism,
actionable items, and overarching themes or issues to assist in your
assessment.

How generative technology will NOT be used in assessment:

No grades will be assigned solely with generative technology at any
point in this course. Assessment will always be done by the instructor
in accordance with the course outlines, because of the unpredictability
and unreliability of current generative technology.

No personal or individual identifiers will ever be included in the
assessment of material by any generative technology.

**APPENDIX TO UNDERGRADUATE COURSE OUTLINES**

**DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL SCIENCE**

**Prerequisite checking - the student's responsibility**

\"Unless you have either the requisites for this course or written
special permission from your Dean to enroll in it, you may be removed
from this course and it will be deleted from your record. This decision
may not be appealed. You will receive no adjustment to your fees in the
event that you are dropped from a course for failing to have the
necessary prerequisites.\"

**Essay course requirements**

With the exception of 1000-level courses, most courses in the Department
of Political Science are essay courses. Total written assignments
(excluding examinations) will be at least 3,000 words in Politics 1020E,
at least 5,000 words in a full course numbered 2000 or above, and at
least 2,500 words in a half course numbered 2000 or above.

**Use of Personal Response Systems ("Clickers")**

\"Personal Response Systems (\"clickers\") may be used in some classes.
If clickers are to be used in a class, it is the responsibility of the
student to ensure that the device is activated and functional. Students
must see their instructor if they have any concerns about whether the
clicker is malfunctioning.

Students must use only their own clicker. If clicker records are used to
compute a portion of the course grade:

- the use of somebody else's clicker in class constitutes a scholastic
  offence,

- the possession of a clicker belonging to another student will be
  interpreted as an attempt to commit a scholastic offence.\"

**Security and Confidentiality of Student Work** (refer to current
Western Academic Calendar

(http://www.westerncalendar.uwo.ca/)

\"Submitting or Returning Student Assignments, Tests and Exams - All
student assignments, tests and exams will be handled in a secure and
confidential manner. Particularly in this respect, leaving student work
unattended in public areas for pickup is not permitted.\"

**Duplication of work**

Undergraduate students who submit similar assignments on closely related
topics in two different courses must obtain the consent of both
instructors prior to the submission of the assignment. If prior approval
is not obtained, each instructor reserves the right not to accept the
assignment.

**Grade adjustments**

In order to ensure that comparable standards are applied in political
science courses, the Department may require instructors to adjust final
marks to conform to Departmental guidelines.

**Academic Offences**

\"Scholastic offences are taken seriously and students are directed to
read the appropriate policy, specifically, the definition of what
constitutes a Scholastic Offence, at the following Web site:

http://www.uwo.ca/univsec/handbook/appeals/scholoff.pdf .\"

**Submission of Course Requirements**

ESSAYS, ASSIGNMENTS, TAKE-HOME EXAMS MUST BE SUBMITTED ACCORDING TO
PROCEDURES SPECIFIED BY YOUR INSTRUCTOR (I.E., IN CLASS, DURING OFFICE
HOURS, TA\'S OFFICE HOURS) OR UNDER THE INSTRUCTOR\'S OFFICE DOOR.

**THE MAIN OFFICE DOES NOT DATE-STAMP OR ACCEPT ANY OF THE ABOVE.**

Note: Information excerpted and quoted above are Senate regulations from
the Handbook of Scholarship and Academic Policy.
http://www.uwo.ca/univsec/handbook/

Students registered in Social Science should refer to
http://counselling.ssc.uwo.ca/
http://counselling.ssc.uwo.ca/procedures/havingproblems.asp for
information on Medical Policy, Term Tests, Final Examinations, Late
Assignments, Short Absences, Extended Absences, Documentation and other
Academic Concerns. Non-Social Science students should refer to their
home faculty's academic counselling office.

**Plagiarism**

\"Plagiarism: Students must write their essays and assignments in their
own words. Whenever students take an idea, or a passage from another
author, they must acknowledge their debt both by using quotation marks
where appropriate and by proper referencing such as footnotes or
citations. Plagiarism is a major academic offence.\" (see Scholastic
Offence Policy in the Western Academic Calendar).

**Plagiarism Checking:** \"All required papers may be subject to
submission for textual similarity review to the commercial plagiarism
detection software under license to the University for the detection of
plagiarism. All papers submitted for such checking will be included as
source documents in the reference database for the purpose of detecting
plagiarism of papers subsequently submitted to the system. Use of the
service is subject to the licensing agreement, currently between The
University of Western Ontario and Turnitin.com ( http://www.turnitin.com
).\"

**Multiple-choice tests/exams:** \"Computer-marked multiple-choice tests
and/or exams may be subject to submission for similarity review by
software that will check for unusual coincidences in answer patterns
that may indicate cheating.\"

**PLAGIARISM\***

In writing scholarly papers, you must keep firmly in mind the need to
avoid plagiarism. Plagiarism is the unacknowledged borrowing of another
writer\'s words or ideas. Different forms of writing require different
types of acknowledgement. The following rules pertain to the
acknowledgements necessary in academic papers.

**A.** **In using another writer\'s words, you must both place the words
in quotation marks and acknowledge that the words are those of another
writer.**

You are plagiarizing if you use a sequence of words, a sentence or a
paragraph taken from other writers without acknowledging them to be
theirs. Acknowledgement is indicated either by (1) mentioning the author
and work from which the words are borrowed in the text of your paper; or
by (2) placing a footnote number at the end of the quotation in your
text, and including a correspondingly numbered footnote at the bottom of
the page (or in a separate reference section at the end of your essay).
This footnote should indicate author, title of the work, place and date
of publication, and page number.

Method (2) given above is usually preferable for academic essays because
it provides the reader with more information about your sources and
leaves your text uncluttered with parenthetical and tangential
references. In either case words taken from another author must be
enclosed in quotation marks or set off from your text by single spacing
and indentation in such a way that they cannot be mistaken for your own
words. Note that you cannot avoid indicating quotation simply by
changing a word or phrase in a sentence or paragraph which is not your
own.

**B.** **In adopting other writers\' ideas, you must acknowledge that
they are theirs.**

You are plagiarizing if you adopt, summarize, or paraphrase other
writers\' trains of argument, ideas or sequences of ideas without
acknowledging their authorship according to the method of
acknowledgement given in \'A\' above. Since the words are your own, they
need not be enclosed in quotation marks. Be certain, however, that the
words you use are entirely your own; where you must use words or phrases
from your source, these should be enclosed in quotation marks, as in
\'A\' above.

Clearly, it is possible for you to formulate arguments or ideas
independently of another writer who has expounded the same ideas, and
whom you have not read. Where you got your ideas is the important
consideration here. Do not be afraid to present an argument or idea
without acknowledgement to another writer, if you have arrived at it
entirely independently. Acknowledge it if you have derived it from a
source outside your own thinking on the subject.

In short, use of acknowledgements and, when necessary, quotation marks
is necessary to distinguish clearly between what is yours and what is
not. Since the rules have been explained to you, if you fail to make
this distinction your instructor very likely will do so for you, and
they will be forced to regard your omission as intentional literary
theft. Plagiarism is a serious offence which may result in a student\'s
receiving an \'F\' in a course or, in extreme cases in their suspension
from the University.
