## For all written work in this course: 

This course requires a minimum of 2500 words of academic prose to meet
university requirements for 3000-level half courses. This includes all
essay-style paragraphs (weekly responses), and any additional written
assignments in cluding the exam.

## For all written exercises, essays and exams in this course: 

## Paragraph structure 

Basic paragraph structure is an important part of writing. Failure to
use basic paragraph structure will result in repetitive, unstructured,
illogical arguments. Paragraphs help to structure our thought, our
ability to make claims and provide a framework for writing. The topic
sentence and concluding sentence of each paragraph should be in your own
voice (no direct references, quotations or citations). A basic paragraph
structure should follow this template:

- Topic/introduction, in one or two sentences and has an argumentative
  sentence that avoids description, and has a clear political thesis

- Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence
  with ***relevant*** academic citation and one sentence explaining the
  relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and
  reflection)

- Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence
  with ***relevant*** academic citation and one sentence explaining the
  relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and
  reflection)

- Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence
  with ***relevant*** academic citation and one sentence explaining the
  relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and
  reflection)

- Summarizing sentence of overall significance to the overarching thesis
  of the paper and

- Concluding sentence which restates topic sentence and bridges to next
  paragraph.

Failure to use basic paragraph structure throughout your work will
result in the inability to receive full marks.

These paragraph formatting requirements are not arbitrary. There is a
specific reason that I want you to use peer-reviewed academic sources, a
MINIMUM of THREE DIFFERENT ACADEMIC SOURCES per paragraph. WHY?

- First, the difference between opinion and argument is the provision of
  evidence.

- Second, for an academic argument to have veracity it needs to have an
  arm\'s length perspective, it needs to draw on peer-reviewed sources
  because individual interpretation is prone to error.

- Next, if we have more than one academic source per paragraph if one of
  those sources is weak or questionable the other two will supplement
  it.

- Moreover, multiple sources prevent summary or representation of
  someone else\'s ideas as your own, if you must interpret multiple data
  sources.

- Finally, academic sources have explanatory frameworks that link them
  to underlying theoretical concepts and ideas. ***News sources, data
  points, and journalism provide evidence without analysis, academic
  work provides analysis with evidence.*** If you don\'t have that
  consistently throughout your writing, you are going to run into
  problems of the veracity of your claims because they lack
  substantiation.

If any of your sentences, paragraphs or quotations lack specific
foundation, you will not receive grades for those submissions.

Lack of data is a lack of foundation. In the era of LLMs, inaccurate
citations will be treated as no citation at all. LLMs routinely
summarize sources without accessing the underlying data. **Failure to
directly quote sources with quotation marks followed by an explanation
in your own words will constitute a lack of sufficient citation.**
**Paraphrasing is no longer sufficient justification for including a
citation**; you must use specific and precise language, including nouns
(specific people, places, and things), as generalized summaries of
sources are often hallucinated, inaccurate, and incomplete when
suggested by LLMs.

## General information about missed coursework

Students must familiarize themselves with the *University Policy on
Academic Consideration -- Undergraduate Students in First Entry
Programs* posted on the Academic Calendar:

<https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/academic_consideration_Sep24.pdf>,

This policy does not apply to requests for Academic Consideration
submitted for **attempted or completed work**, whether online or in
person.

The policy also does not apply to students experiencing longer-term
impacts on their academic responsibilities. These students should
consult [Accessible
Education](http://academicsupport.uwo.ca/accessible_education/).

For procedures on how to submit Academic Consideration requests, please
see the information posted on the Office of the Registrar's webpage:

<https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/>

All requests for Academic Consideration must be made within 48 hours
after the assessment date or submission deadline.

All Academic Consideration requests must include supporting
documentation; however, recognizing that formal documentation may not be
available in some extenuating circumstances, the policy allows students
to make [one]{.underline} Academic Consideration request **without
supporting documentation** in this course. However, the following
assessments are excluded from this, and therefore always require formal
supporting documentation:

Term Assignment

When a student *[mistakenly]{.underline}* submits their
[one]{.underline} allowed Academic Consideration request **without
supporting documentation** for the assessments listed above or those in
the **Coursework with Assessment Flexibility** section below, [the
request cannot be recalled and reapplied]{.underline}. This privilege is
forfeited.

Coursework with Assessment Flexibility

By policy, instructors may deny Academic Consideration requests for the
following assessments with built-in flexibility.

Religious Accommodation

When conflicts with a religious holiday that requires an absence from
the University or prohibits certain activities, students should request
an accommodation for their absence in writing to the course instructor
and/or the Academic Advising office of their Faculty of Registration.
This notice should be made as early as possible but not later than two
weeks prior to the writing or the examination (or one week prior to the
writing of the test).

Please visit the Diversity Calendars posted on our university's EDID
website for the recognized religious holidays:
[https://www.edi.uwo.ca](https://www.edi.uwo.ca/)

Accommodation Policies

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact Accessible
Education, which provides recommendations for accommodation based on
medical documentation or psychological and cognitive testing. The policy
on Academic Accommodation for Students with Disabilities can be found
at:
<https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/Academic%20Accommodation_disabilities.pdf>

Academic Policies- The website for Registrar Services is
<https://www.registrar.uwo.ca/>.

In accordance with policy,
<https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/policies_procedures/section1/mapp113.pdf>

the centrally administered e-mail account provided to students will be
considered the individual's official university e-mail address. It is
the responsibility of the account holder to ensure that e-mail received
from the University at their official university address is attended to
in a timely manner.

Scholastic offences are taken seriously and students are directed to
read the appropriate policy, specifically, the definition of what
constitutes a Scholastic Offence, at the following Web site:

<https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/scholastic_discipline_undergrad.pdf>

All required papers may be subject to submission for textual similarity
review to the commercial plagiarism detection software under license to
the University for the detection of plagiarism. All papers submitted for
such checking will be included as source documents in the reference
database for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of papers subsequently
submitted to the system. Use of the service is subject to the licensing
agreement, currently between The University of Western Ontario and
Turnitin.com ([http://www.turnitin.com](http://www.turnitin.com/)).

## Weekly Work

All students - Weekly participation 15%

Students writing the essay only need to complete the quiz and the weekly
group work, 10 of 12 weeks to get full marks. The quiz must be
attempted; any particular score is not necessary to achieve the
participation mark. The group work must be recorded through the
Microsoft form during the week of class, failure to document your group
work makes it ineligible for participation.

Missed classes - For students choosing Option 1 (students writing an
essay). Any missed weekly participation can be supplemented with a
written response option below; however students writing the essay cannot
achieve more than 15% on weekly participation.

Option 2 - (students choosing not to write an essay) Written responses
20%

Base submission is a pass/fail 70% of the grade. 80% weekly for
participation that is acceptable but needs substantive improvement. 85%
for participation that is mostly acceptable. 90%+ for acceptable
participation with the response in Brightspace being 'ok'.

Students choosing Option 2 (not writing an essay) **must** complete a
written **engagement option weekly** (Tuesday 12:01 am - Monday 11:59
pm) to fulfill participation requirements. Submitting your written
participation work on the day of class receives a 5% bonus (bringing the
base to 75%). The mark comes from a 250-word paragraph responses or
infographic, and they need to follow the paragraph requirements outlined
in this syllabus. **A total of 10 weeks of participation is required**,
allowing students to skip 2 weeks (e.g., weeks 1 and 12). The total
grade is calculated on Week 12 following the requirements below.

Option 3 - students choosing to write an essay and not an exam

Students choosing Option 3 (writing an essay, but not an exam) **must**
complete a written **engagement option weekly** (Tuesday 12:01 am -
Monday 11:59 pm) to fulfill participation requirements. Submitting your
written participation work on the day of class receives a 5% bonus
(bringing the base to 75%). The mark comes from a 250-word paragraph
responses or infographic, and they need to follow the paragraph
requirements outlined in this syllabus. **A total of 10 weeks of
participation is required**, allowing students to skip 2 weeks (e.g.,
weeks 1 and 12). The total grade is calculated on Week 12 following the
requirements below.

Weekly Written Engagement Options:

1.  **Written Responses (250 words per lesson)**

*Written Responses (250 words per lesson):* A **reflective** analysis
engaging with lesson ideas and concepts from lectures, readings, or
both. This is not a summary but a critical engagement that links
material to current international law. ***You must add your own people,
events, or issues to the response that are outside of the readings.***
There are prompts available next to the weekly readings that should
guide your response. Proper essay paragraph structure and intext
citations are required where applicable. You must reference the course
readings at least three times per week to get maximum grades.
Submissions not meeting these standards are ineligible for full credit.
Each written response counts for one participation mark. See detailed
criteria below.

2.  **Infographic** (minimum 250 words per week)

For the infographic option, students must produce a visually compelling
and clearly organized visual argument that shows critical engagement
with this week's material. The infographic should draw directly on at
least two course readings, including direct quotations that are embedded
meaningfully in the visual narrative. It must reflect current debates in
Canada, using events or policy developments from the past few weeks to
make clear why the material matters now. The assignment should not just
present information but take a position, expose a political issue, or
offer a critique based on the themes of the week. A bibliography in
proper citation format must be included at the bottom or on a final
panel. Minimum 250 words. See the google sheet tab with 'sample
assignments' for an example of a successful infographic.

Calculating participation:\
Q: Why do you do it this way? A: We use this structure to reduce
unconscious bias and subjective grading. Participation becomes
transparent and equitable because grades are based on clear, objective
evidence---not attendance, personality, or assumptions. Credit for
submissions require documented improvement and, for written work, direct
citation of weekly readings.

Q: What does it mean to calculate participation? A: Calculating
participation minimizes unconscious bias, groupthink, and subjective
grading. It creates a clear, fair structure for assessment. At the end
of the course, students self-calculate their participation based on what
they submitted each week. We only count your top 10 submissions. If
there are any exceptional circumstances, please document them in your
final attachment summary and explain how they impact your calculation. I
reserve the right to reassess any or all participation during the final
calculation.\
\
Sample calculation\
w1 85 - 'more precise'\
w2 85 - 'more precise'\
w3 85 -- 'too colloquial'\
w4 85 -- 'clarity needed'\
w5 85 - 'concluding bubble missing information'\
w6 0\
w7 85 - 'urls and conclusion need improvement'\
w8 85 'need for direct quotes'\
w9 70\
w10 90 -- 'ok\'\
w11 90- 'ok'\
w12 0\
7 weeks at 85 = 7x85 = 595\
2 weeks at 90 = 180\
1 week at 70 = 70

595+180+70 = 845 = 84.5%

## Attendance Bonus (5% on Final Exam ***or*** Essay - whichever is 40%)

Students will receive a 1% bonus on their final exam or essay grade for
every two classes attended (attendance must be recorded through the
Microsoft form each week during class time), with a maximum of 10
classes considered to earn the full 5% bonus. You can check your
participation through the link in Brightspace weekly. You cannot receive
more than 100% on the final exam or essay.

## Term Assignment 

Option 1 - Debate:

Students must sign up for a presentation by the end of Week 3 on the
link in Brightspace or they forfeit their grade.
<http://tiny.cc/3201_2026>

In teams of two ONLY, students should pick a specific case related to
their area of interest from the legal briefs provided on week one. The
debate should outline the key issues and points of contention and
present each side coherently and convincingly to the class. Each pair
should try to convey the perspective of the two sides as well as the
actual outcome. MAXIMUM 5 MINUTES. You cannot do the ICJ US v Nicaragua
case that we discuss on week 2.\
The presentation should highlight:\
1. Key parties involved\
2. Relevant context (or legal mechanisms) related to the issue\
3. Arguments put forward on each side\
4. Cases in support of each side\
5. Resolution of the case and the implications

Students will need to upload their presentation in an accessible and
clear format (such as a tiktok or YouTube) for each week they sign up.
Students must present on the week they sign up or else they forfeit
their grade. Students are encouraged to think creatively about how they
will present the debate and presentations may take alternative formats
as long as they accomplish the requirements outlined above. In order to
receive an individual mark students must post a short (200 word) summary
of their role in the debate preparation and execution, assessing their
groups' strengths and weaknesses in Brightspace. All written work must
use proper essay paragraph structure and conform to the 'criteria for
the evaluation of written assignments' below or it cannot achieve full
grades.

## Essay (if chosen) Due the end of Week 10 in Brightspace under 'assignments'. 

##  (The final draft of the paper should be 8 pages (2000 words +/-10% strictly enforced) in length (excluding the bibliography) and must be presented in proper scholarly format. The instructor may require that 10% of randomly selected students will have to meet to discuss their paper after completion to ensure there has been no improper LLM use.

The essay will be chosen from a pre-approved topic, and explicit
discussion of one of the approved approaches from the course. The
assignment must be in proper formal essay format (no bullet points,
short form or colloquial language, can use subheadings to identify
sections, use proper citation and should NOT INCLUDE ANY FORM OF
ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY. Dictionaries, encyclopedias, and Wikipedia
should not be used, and use of web material is subject to instructor's
prior approval. A basic structure for the essay will include:

1\) Title that clearly answers the question for your topic, the list of
approved topics is available in Brightspace.

2\) The assignment should highlight the area of interest of your
research; the relevant International legal mechanisms (such as state
obligation, inchoate title, ICJ decisions, ICTR or ICTY precedent, etc.)
and how your essay will answer the assigned as a question from the
approved essay topic list.

3\) A clear and explicit explanatory response to the question based on
your topic (i.e. your thesis). You must explain the efficacy of
international law in the context of your topic. Pre-approved questions
are available in Brightspace, they must be answered in order to complete
the assignment.

4\) Three key distinct arguments with evidence in support of the thesis.
You must follow the paragraph structure and citation format in the
course outline. The essay topics should deal with some aspect of an
international legal body, a specific incident (either historical or
ongoing) and a clear perspective in the essay on why the topic matters
given class discussion.

5\) The paper MUST reference at least three of the specific legal
case/decision/ juridical outcome (i.e. a key ICJ or International legal
cases discussed throughout the course and in the Casenotes book. Failure
to cite a minimum of three cases will result in a failure to achieve
full grades. Substantive engagement with the course materials is also
required, a failure to integrate the course readings will limit your
ability to get full grades. YOU CANNOT CITE THE CASES DIRECTLY - all
discussions of relevant cases must come from academic sources only.

6\) A complete list of all sources used in the paper (i.e. your
bibliography) as well as accurately and properly cited academic material
throughout. This may include non‐academic sources, but there must be a
minimum of 4 academic, peer-reviewed sources (and they should cover at
least three different themes in your work), with an emphasis on course
material.

7\) All written work must use proper essay paragraph structure and
conform to the 'criteria for the evaluation of written assignments'
below or it cannot achieve full grades.

Papers submitted before the deadline are available to revise and
resubmit the assignment. For details on revision and resubmission see
the 'revise and resubmit' tab in brightspace.

The Department's rules regarding plagiarism and the submission of
similar essays to two or more different instructors are appended to this
course outline and should be noted. (See 'Criteria for Evaluation of
Written Assignments' below).

## Final Exam: To be held online during the scheduled exam period. 

20 or 40% of final course grade (depending on course options chosen).
For those who choose the essay or the exam is worth 20%. For those who
choose the weekly responses the final exam is worth 40%. To be scheduled
during the exam period. The final exam will be cumulative (i.e., will be
based on the material covered in lectures, assigned readings, and
discussions throughout the whole of the course). The exam may include
both a short answer/identification component and questions requiring
longer, essay-style responses. Choice of answers and an exam preparation
guide may be given.

## Zoom Etiquette

1.  Please pay attention to video, microphone and screensharing
    settings. Keep chat rooms and images appropriate for an academic
    setting. Any inappropriate actions, imagery, discussion or chat
    messages may result in your removal from the meeting at my

## Guidelines for Success in Class

Since there seldom are definitive answers to the questions we will be
asking about international law relations, and much of what you will
learn in this course will be enhanced by the ideas and perspectives of
your colleagues. But for this to work, everyone must participate fully
and constructively. Be mindful of the following points, and you will be
successful:

1.  • Come to all classes having read the assigned readings for that
    week and prepared to participate in discussion. It is useful to
    remember that some week's readings may be more relevant to your
    research interests than others, and focusing on readings that are
    most salient to your interests will ensure maximum usefulness in the
    course.

    • Participate in discussions, but do not over-participate. Everyone
    must be given an opportunity to take part in discussions.
    Constructive participation involves the raising of *relevant* points
    and ideas. Online participation will be considered as well in
    participation marks.

    • Demonstrate respect for the ideas presented by others at all
    times. This is essential to open discussion and the free exchange of
    ideas. This does not mean that you must agree with others. Informal
    debate will teach you even more about your own position while
    simultaneously exposing you to different viewpoints. Make use of
    such opportunities, but no disrespectful behavior will be tolerated.

    • Raise questions when you have them. Raising useful questions
    counts as participation. You can use minute papers, online forums,
    e-mail, facebook or in class lecture to raise questions you
    encounter throughout the course. Uncertainties are usually shared by
    others -- when you raise your questions in class everyone learns
    while you build your own participation grade.

# Criteria for the evaluation of written assignments

## Paragraph structure 

Basic paragraph structure is an important part of writing. Failure to
use basic paragraph structure will result in repetitive, unstructured,
illogical arguments. Paragraphs help to structure our thought, our
ability to make claims and provide a framework for writing. The topic
sentence and concluding sentence of each paragraph should be in your own
voice (no direct references, quotations or citations). A basic paragraph
structure should follow this template:

- Topic/introduction, in one or two sentences

- Major point with evidence one or two sentences (one sentence with
  academic citation and one sentence explaining the relevance in your
  own words)

- Major point with evidence one or two sentences (one sentence with
  academic citation and one sentence explaining the relevance in your
  own words)

- Major point with evidence one or two sentences (one sentence with
  academic citation and one sentence explaining the relevance in your
  own words)

- Summarizing sentence of overall significance to the overarching thesis
  of the paper and

- Concluding sentence which restates topic sentence and bridges to next
  paragraph.

Failure to use basic paragraph structure throughout your work will
result in the inability to receive full marks.

These paragraph formatting requirements are not arbitrary. There is a
specific reason that I want you to use peer-reviewed academic sources, a
MINIMUM of THREE DIFFERENT ACADEMIC SOURCES per paragraph. WHY?

- First, the difference between opinion and argument is the provision of
  evidence.

- Second, for an academic argument to have veracity, it needs to have an
  arm\'s length perspective, it needs to draw on peer-reviewed sources
  because individual interpretation is prone to error.

- Next, if we have more than one academic source per paragraph if one of
  those sources is weak or questionable the other two will supplement
  it.

- Moreover, multiple sources prevent summary or representation of
  someone else\'s ideas as your own, if you must interpret multiple data
  sources.

- Finally, academic sources have explanatory frameworks that link them
  to underlying theoretical concepts and ideas. News sources, data
  points, and journalism provide evidence without analysis, academic
  work provides analysis with evidence. If you don\'t have that
  consistently throughout your writing, you are going to run into
  problems of the veracity of your claims because they lack
  substantiation.

## Formatting

All work should be double spaced using 12-point font (even on policy
briefs). Page numbers should always be included. Never use bullet points
anywhere -- they condense ideas when I need to see the logic and
academic argumentation that underpin your claims.

## Quotations

Quotations longer than 4 lines should be indented. Try to avoid
quotations longer than 4 lines. Assume that I do not read an indented
4line quotation and make sure the sentence immediately following the
quotation summarizes its significance to your argument in your own
words. Never include quotations or sources in your introduction or
conclusion, your introduction and conclusion should outline the paper
structure in your own words.

## Citations and Bibliography

Lack of data is a lack of foundation. In the era of LLMs, inaccurate
citations will be treated as no citation at all. LLMs routinely
summarize sources without accessing the underlying data. **Failure to
directly quote sources with quotation marks followed by an explanation
in your own words will constitute a lack of sufficient citation.**
**Paraphrasing is no longer sufficient justification for including a
citation**; you must use specific and precise language, including nouns
(specific people, places, and things), as generalized summaries of
sources are often hallucinated, inaccurate, and incomplete when
suggested by LLMs.

## Bibliography (style: Modified Harvard) - no footnotes or endnotes are allowed for citation

> A bibliography must be included in all written work, it should include
> the complete details of the work and included an 'Accessed' date if it
> is an online source.

We will use the author date system. It keeps footnotes and endnotes to a
minimum.

- Text references will be short with the Surname, Date and page number
  (i.e. Žižek 2002: 342).

- Use this formatting everywhere, including sources from our reading
  list and in the response papers and any written work.

- Works by the same author in the same year should be cited as Žižek
  2002a, Žižek2002b, etc.

- Et al. can be used by sources with three or more authors. The full
  list must be in the bibliography.

- If you have more than one source in the same sentence you just include
  them with a semi-colon in chronological order i.e (Žižek 2002: 345;
  D'Amelio 2018: 212; Swift 2020: 445)

***Analytical Content*: Higher** grades will be given to work that
demonstrates the ability to interpret, critically assess and develop
insights of the material. To determine whether or not your argument is
analytical, ask yourself \"Am I demonstrating to the reader my insights
in an academic way?" If you are simply summarizing or describing in
detail phenomena, your work is unlikely to have high analytical content.

> *Helpful signs you are not developing analytical content: Excessive
> quotes; beginning or ending a paragraph with a quote; short (fewer
> than 4 sentences) paragraphs; no sources in a long paragraph; lack of
> similar argument in introduction and conclusion.*

***Development of an Argument*: Higher** grades will be given to work
that has a clearly stated argument and a set of logically developed and
reasonably comprehensive points in support of that argument. Academic
arguments need not be personal (though in certain instances they can be
-- check with the instructor), rather they demonstrate the logical
progression of the position you are developing. The key here is to
attempt to convince your reader of the soundness or feasibility of your
argument. Nuanced arguments recognize obvious criticisms and seek to
address them logically. Consistency of an argument throughout a paper is
important.

> *Helpful signs your argument may be in trouble: Using the same author
> or quote more than a few times in successive paragraphs; your
> introduction and conclusion are not similar; you introduce material in
> the introduction and the conclusion that cannot be found elsewhere;
> you have quotes in your conclusion; your attempt to address obvious
> criticisms contradicts your thesis, you adopt multiple theoretical
> frameworks; you cannot find any sources that agree with your central
> claims.*

***Grammar, Spelling, and Style*:** Higher grades will be given to
written work that is grammatically correct and is clearly and accurately
written, while lower grades will be given to work that is difficult to
read or understand due to excessive grammatical and/or spelling errors.

> *While different approaches work for different people, it is
> recommended that you try the following every time you have a written
> assignment: after completing your assignment, put it away for a while
> (ideally, for a few days); when you pick it up again, read it
> carefully, slowly, and aloud (when we are familiar with a paper we
> tend to skim it during proof-reading, thereby missing errors -- so
> make sure you are reading it word for word). Mistakes in grammar may
> not always look wrong, but they usually sound wrong. If you need some
> help with writing style or grammar, there are many resources available
> on campus.*

*Meeting the Requirements of the Assignment*: All written work must be
submitted on time, must be of the appropriate length, must use the
required number and type of resources, and, most importantly, must
address the issues or questions posed in the assignment.

## Revise and resubmit for the essay only (weekly responses and exams have no revise and resubmit option)

## Everyone in all of my third and fourth year courses has one \'revise and resubmit\' on every written assignment. I do this as practice because that\'s how my papers and chapters are reviewed by editors, and it\'s a primary value of the university experience, editing and revising.

## Written assignments in this course are able to be revised and resubmitted once and once only.

## If you want to use this as a draft option, you can hand in your written assignment early.

## In most cases, you will want to revise and resubmit the substantial assignments first, such as an essay.

## For students submitting on time: I follow a first-in-first-out essay submission system. If you submit your essay on time I will aspire to have it back as soon as possible, so you can revise and resubmit it asap.

##  For students submitting with an approved extension: it\'s less likely that you will get the essay back in time to revise it. Please keep that in mind. 

## Resubmission rules

##  1. Resubmissions can only result in a higher grade, as long as you track changes. **You must track changes.** If you do not track changes I will have to remark your paper from scratch and your grade is no longer guaranteed to improve. We use the online version of Word - we can track changes with \--\'review\'-\> \'track changes\'\--\> \'track changes for everyone\'

##  2. You **must include a grade goal** for your revised paper. The grade goal lets me assess the extent to which you have taken my comments and feedback and made sufficient changes to achieve your grade goal.

##  3. **You will not receive a second set of comments** on the revisions only a revised grade. This is standard practice in publishing as well (revisions are sufficient and they publish or revisions are insufficient and they reject).

##  4. All resubmissions must be submitted before you write your exam for the course.

## General

All students must complete all course requirements. Failure to do so
(e.g., by not handing-in an assignment or by missing an examination
without due cause) will subject the student to the appropriate
University regulations. Students must also keep a duplicate copy of
their assignments.

## Policy on communication

The forums should be your primary place for questions, issues and
concerns with the course. I strive to be accessible and responsive to
student inquiries. However, repeated or persistent e-mails/texts/phone
calls will overload my capacity to respond to all students equally. As
such, I reserve the right to answer initial questions but forego
multiple responses or inquires for a 24hour cool-down period. I
appreciate your understanding in this matter.

## Late Assignments - Formal Guidelines

Late papers will be accepted but will be subject to a late penalty of 10
per cent per day to a maximum of 5 days, after which they will not be
accepted and a mark of 0 will be recorded. In the interest of fairness
to all students, there will be no exceptions to this unless you have
arranged in advance for an extension. All extensions must be arranged in
advance of the day on which a paper is due. Papers submitted after
deadlines (including excused late papers) will be marked, but comments
will not be provided.

## Policy on Children in the classroom[^1] 

"It is my belief that if we want women in academia, that we should also
expect children to be present in some form. Currently, the university
does not have a formal policy on children in the classroom. The policy
described here is thus, a reflection of my own beliefs and commitments
to student, staff and faculty parents.

All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as is
necessary to support the breastfeeding relationship. Because not all
women can pump sufficient milk, and not all babies will take a bottle
reliably, I never want students to feel like they have to choose between
feeding their baby and continuing their education. You and your nursing
baby are welcome in class anytime.

For older children and babies, I understand that minor illnesses and
unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of
having to chose between missing class to stay home with a child and
leaving him or her with someone you or the child does not feel
comfortable with. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare
solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps
in care is perfectly acceptable.

I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment
that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in
parenting status.

In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit
close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and
is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until
their need has been met. Non-parents in the class, please reserve seats
near the door for your parenting classmates.

Finally, I understand that often the largest barrier to completing your
coursework once you become a parent is the tiredness many parents feel
in the evening once children have finally gone to sleep. The struggles
of balancing school, childcare and often another job are exhausting! I
hope that you will feel comfortable disclosing your student-parent
status to me. This is the first step in my being able to accommodate any
special needs that arise. While I maintain the same high expectations
for all student in my classes regardless of parenting status, I am happy
to problem solve with you in a way that makes you feel supported as you
strive for school-parenting balance. Thank you for the diversity you
bring to our classroom!"

## Policy on non-service animals in the classroom 

Western University established a [Pets and Therapy Animals policy in May
2020](https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/policies_procedures/section1/mapp156.pdf)
that limits the presence of pets in campus buildings. Service and
therapy animals are permitted inside all Western locations, in
accordance with accessibility policies, however animals for
companionship are not allowed.

## Religious/Cultural Observance 

Persons who have religious or cultural observances that coincide with
this class should let the instructor know in writing (by e-mail for
example) by Week 4. I strongly encourage you to honor your cultural and
religious holidays! However, if I do not hear from you by Week 4, I will
assume that you plan to attend all class meetings.

## Point of View

The readings, class lectures, and my comments in class will suggest a
particular point of view. This perspective is my own and does not have
to be yours! I encourage you to disagree with the ideas in the readings
and lectures as well as the perspectives of your colleagues in the
course. Please express yourself! A significant part of a university
education is learning about the complexity of various issues; therefore,
it is important that we listen and respect one another but we do not
have to agree. A richer discussion will occur when a variety of
perspectives are presented in class for discussion.

## Academic Sources

A key aspect of the university experience is developing your ability to
assess the validity of sources. Academic sources such as those found on
Google Scholar should be your primary source of arguments, ideas and
claims made in the course. While it may be appropriate to provide
anecdotal, non-academic, news, theories from outside the academy as data
points, all arguments must be situated in triangulated academic
research. By triangulation (you may see a ∆ on your assignments) this is
the idea that academic peer review provides a foundation for the
veracity of the claims being made. if you rely too heavily on one source
(i.e. that more than 3 footnotes in a row are from the same source) you
may be veering towards summary or plagiarism of that source as it lacks
proper verification from other academics who agree with those
assessments. Moreover, most sources have implicit or explicit
frameworks, understandings, biases which you may not be able to assess
without triangulation. While there is no explicit number of sources
required on assignments, you will be unable to achieve full marks if you
do not have academic arguments with academic sources. This is a standard
expectation of all assignments in this class.

## Discussion Guidelines[^2]

In our structured and unstructured discussions and dialogues, we also
will have many opportunities to explore some challenging, high-stakes
issues and increase our understandings of different perspectives. Our
conversations may not always be easy; we sometimes will make mistakes in
our speaking and our listening; sometimes we will need patience or
courage or imagination or any number of qualities in combination to
engage our texts, our classmates, and our own ideas and experiences.
Always we will need respect for others. Thus, an important secondary aim
of our course necessarily will be for us to increase our facility with
the sometimes-difficult conversations that arise inside issues of social
inequality as we deepen our understandings of multiple perspectives --
whatever our backgrounds, experiences, or positions.

## Policy on the use of LLMs (AI, ChatGPT, Bard, etc) in the classroom **^3^**

Unless otherwise noted during class activities, you may only use ChatGPT
or any other Generative technology to *aid* or *nuance* your thinking,
communication, and learning; but not to *replace* or *subvert* it. See
the table below for some examples of allowable and non-allowable uses of
Generative technology in this class (NOTE: This is not an exhaustive
list of examples). Generative technology may be used to assist in
assessment throughout the course, if you wish to opt out of the use of
generative technology, please let me know.

How generative technology may be used in assessment:

1\. Pre-assessment - to provide structural or overall feedback before I
begin any grading.

2\. Applying rubric - using the rubric from the course outline to apply
to submitted assignments to assess the degree of compliance before or
during I complete any grading.

3\. During assessment - to double-check the veracity of claims being
made about your submission during my assessment of your material.

4\. Post assessment - to find additional examples or instances in your
submissions to assist in my feedback.

5\. Refining assessment - suggesting forms of constructive criticism,
actionable items, and overarching themes or issues to assist in your
assessment.

6\. Checking for unauthorized AI use, following University guidelines
(and those attached below).

How generative technology will NOT be used in assessment:

No grades will be assigned solely with generative technology at any
point in this course. Assessment will always be done by the instructor
in accordance with the course outlines, because of the unpredictability
and unreliability of current generative technology.

No personal or individual identifiers will ever be included in the
assessment of material by any generative technology.
