# Introduction: 

This course traces the colonial lineage of political science and
political studies through a decolonial reading of key texts. With an
emphasis on the role of the academy in imperialism, racism, settler
colonialism and hierarchies of intersectionality, this course examines
the subfields of political science and forms of decolonial mobilization.
Topics range from the ongoing practices of settler colonialism to the
role of affect and race in humanitarianism, as well as strategies and
practices of activism, the logics of terrorism and queer approaches to
Eurocentric politics.

## Learning Objectives:

Through this course all students will have the opportunity to:

- Discuss different approaches to decolonizing current affairs in world
  politics

- Describe the key events, changes over time and the current state of
  current affairs in world politics in the context of decolonization

- Think critically and write about an issue in current affairs through a
  decolonial framework

- Discuss a current affair in world politics in historical and
  decolonial context

Anti-requisites: Former International Relations 2701/2702, IR 2704

Prerequisites: Political Science 1020E

+---------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

## For all written work in this course: 

This course requires a minimum of 2500 words of academic prose to meet
university requirements for 3000-level half courses. This includes all
essay-style paragraphs (weekly responses), the term assignment, and any
additional written assignments including the exam.

## Paragraph structure 

Basic paragraph structure is an important part of writing. Failure to
use basic paragraph structure will result in repetitive, unstructured,
and illogical arguments. Paragraphs help to structure our thoughts, our
ability to make claims, and provide a framework for writing. The topic
sentence and concluding sentence of each paragraph should be in your own
voice (no direct references, quotations, or citations). A basic
paragraph structure should follow this template:

- Topic/introduction, in one or two sentences

- Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence
  with ***relevant*** academic citation and one sentence explaining the
  relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and
  reflection)

- Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence
  with ***relevant*** academic citation and one sentence explaining the
  relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and
  reflection)

- Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence
  with ***relevant*** academic citation and one sentence explaining the
  relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and
  reflection)

- Summarizing sentence of overall significance to the overarching thesis
  of the paper and

- Concluding sentence which restates topic sentence and bridges to next
  paragraph.

Failure to use basic paragraph structure throughout your work will
result in the inability to receive full marks.

These paragraph formatting requirements are not arbitrary. There is a
specific reason that I want you to use peer-reviewed academic sources, a
MINIMUM of THREE DIFFERENT ACADEMIC SOURCES per paragraph. WHY?

- First, the difference between opinion and argument is the provision of
  evidence.

- Second, for an academic argument to have veracity, it needs to have an
  arm\'s length perspective, it needs to draw on peer-reviewed sources
  because individual interpretation is prone to error.

- Next, if we have more than one academic source per paragraph if one of
  those sources is weak or questionable the other two will supplement
  it.

- Moreover, multiple sources prevent summary or representation of
  someone else\'s ideas as your own, if you must interpret multiple data
  sources.

- Finally, academic sources have explanatory frameworks that link them
  to underlying theoretical concepts and ideas. News sources, data
  points, and journalism provide evidence without analysis, academic
  work provides analysis with evidence. If you don\'t have that
  consistently throughout your writing, you are going to run into
  problems of the veracity of your claims because they lack
  substantiation.

If any of your sentences, paragraphs, or quotations lack a specific
foundation, you will not receive credit for those submissions.

Lack of data is a lack of foundation. In the era of LLMs, inaccurate
citations will be treated as no citation at all. LLMs routinely
summarize sources without accessing the underlying data. **Failure to
directly quote sources with quotation marks followed by an explanation
in your own words will constitute a lack of sufficient citation.**
**Paraphrasing is no longer sufficient justification for including a
citation**; you must use specific and precise language, including nouns
(specific people, places, and things), as generalized summaries of
sources are often hallucinated, inaccurate, and incomplete when
suggested by LLMs.

## Basic steps to decolonization for all work in this course

1.  Recontextualize political thinkers within their context -- what is
    the role of imperialism and settler colonialism in their time.

2.  Use imperialism and colonialism to understand the logic of these
    thinker\'s arguments so that 'recontextualization leads to
    reconceptualization'.

3.  Challenging epistemology - how was it that knowledge came to be
    understood as valid, and what was invalidated in the process?

## General information about missed coursework

Students must familiarize themselves with the *University Policy on
Academic Consideration -- Undergraduate Students in First Entry
Programs* posted on the Academic Calendar:

<https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/academic_consideration_Sep24.pdf>,

This policy does not apply to requests for Academic Consideration
submitted for **attempted or completed work**, whether online or in
person.

The policy also does not apply to students experiencing longer-term
impacts on their academic responsibilities. These students should
consult [Accessible
Education](http://academicsupport.uwo.ca/accessible_education/).

For procedures on how to submit Academic Consideration requests, please
see the information posted on the Office of the Registrar's webpage:

<https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/>

All requests for Academic Consideration must be made within 48 hours
after the assessment date or submission deadline.

All Academic Consideration requests must include supporting
documentation; however, recognizing that formal documentation may not be
available in some extenuating circumstances, the policy allows students
to make [one]{.underline} Academic Consideration request **without
supporting documentation** in this course. However, the following
assessments are excluded from this, and therefore always require formal
supporting documentation:

Term Assignment

When a student *[mistakenly]{.underline}* submits their
[one]{.underline} allowed Academic Consideration request **without
supporting documentation** for the assessments listed above or those in
the **Coursework with Assessment Flexibility** section below, [the
request cannot be recalled and reapplied]{.underline}. This privilege is
forfeited.

Coursework with Assessment Flexibility

By policy, instructors may deny Academic Consideration requests for the
following assessments with built-in flexibility.

Flexible Completion assignments:

Weekly participation. This course has 12 weekly participation
assignments, and the 10 quizzes with the highest marks are counted
towards your final grade. Should extenuating circumstances arise,
students do not need to request Academic Consideration for the first 2
missed weekly participations. Academic consideration requests will be
denied for the first 2 missed weekly participation assignments.

Religious Accommodation

When conflicts with a religious holiday that requires an absence from
the University or prohibits certain activities, students should request
an accommodation for their absence in writing to the course instructor
and/or the Academic Advising office of their Faculty of Registration.
This notice should be made as early as possible but not later than two
weeks prior to the writing or the examination (or one week prior to the
writing of the test).

Please visit the Diversity Calendars posted on our university's EDID
website for the recognized religious holidays:
[https://www.edi.uwo.ca](https://www.edi.uwo.ca/)

Accommodation Policies

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact Accessible
Education, which provides recommendations for accommodation based on
medical documentation or psychological and cognitive testing. The policy
on Academic Accommodation for Students with Disabilities can be found

In accordance with policy,
<https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/policies_procedures/section1/mapp113.pdf>

the centrally administered e-mail account provided to students will be
considered the individual's official university e-mail address. It is
the responsibility of the account holder to ensure that e-mail received
from the University at their official university address is attended to
in a timely manner.

Scholastic offences are taken seriously and students are directed to
read the appropriate policy, specifically, the definition of what
constitutes a Scholastic Offence, at the following Web site:

<https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/scholastic_discipline_undergrad.pdf>

All required papers may be subject to submission for textual similarity
review to the commercial plagiarism detection software under license to
the University for the detection of plagiarism. All papers submitted for
such checking will be included as source documents in the reference
database for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of papers subsequently
submitted to the system. Use of the service is subject to the licensing
agreement, currently between The University of Western Ontario and
Turnitin.com ([http://www.turnitin.com](http://www.turnitin.com/)).

## Weekly Work

All students - Weekly participation 15%

Students writing the essay only need to complete the quiz and the weekly
group work, 10 of 12 weeks to get full marks. The quiz must be
attempted; any particular score is not necessary to achieve the
participation mark. The group work must be recorded through the
Microsoft form during the week of class, failure to document your group
work makes it ineligible for participation.

Missed classes - For students choosing Option 1 (students writing an
essay). Any missed weekly participation can be supplemented with a
written response option below; however students writing the essay cannot
achieve more than 15% on weekly participation.

Option 2 - (students choosing not to write an essay) Written responses
20%

Base submission is a pass/fail 70% of the grade. 80% weekly for
participation that is acceptable but needs substantive improvement. 85%
for participation that is mostly acceptable. 90%+ for acceptable
participation with the response in Brightspace being 'ok'.

Students choosing Option 2 (not writing an essay) **must** complete a
written **engagement option weekly** (Thursday 12:01 am - Wednesday
11:59 pm) to fulfill participation requirements. Submitting your written
participation work on the day of class receives a 5% bonus (bringing the
base to 75%). The mark comes from a 250-word paragraph responses or
infographic, and they need to follow the paragraph requirements outlined
in this syllabus. **A total of 10 weeks of participation is required**,
allowing students to skip 2 weeks (e.g., weeks 1 and 12). The total
grade is calculated on Week 12 following the requirements below.\
\
Option 3 - students choosing to write an essay and not an exam

Students choosing Option 3 (writing an essay, but not an exam) **must**
complete a written **engagement option weekly** (Tuesday 12:01 am -
Monday 11:59 pm) to fulfill participation requirements. Submitting your
written participation work on the day of class receives a 5% bonus
(bringing the base to 75%). The mark comes from a 250-word paragraph
responses or infographic, and they need to follow the paragraph
requirements outlined in this syllabus. **A total of 10 weeks of
participation is required**, allowing students to skip 2 weeks (e.g.,
weeks 1 and 12). The total grade is calculated on Week 12 following the
requirements below.

Weekly Written Engagement Options:

1.  **Written Responses (250 words per lesson)**

*Written Responses (250 words per lesson):* A **reflective** analysis
engaging with lesson ideas and concepts from lectures, readings, or
both. This is not a summary but a critical engagement that links
material to current international law. ***You must add your own people,
events, or issues to the response that are outside of the readings.***
There are prompts available next to the weekly readings that should
guide your response. Proper essay paragraph structure and intext
citations are required where applicable. You must reference the course
readings at least three times per week to get maximum grades.
Submissions not meeting these standards are ineligible for full credit.
Each written response counts for one participation mark. See detailed
criteria below.

2.  **Infographic** (minimum 250 words per week)

For the infographic option, students must produce a visually compelling
and clearly organized visual argument that shows critical engagement
with this week's material. The infographic should draw directly on at
least two course readings, including direct quotations that are embedded
meaningfully in the visual narrative. It must reflect current debates in
Canada, using events or policy developments from the past few weeks to
make clear why the material matters now. The assignment should not just
present information but take a position, expose a political issue, or
offer a critique based on the themes of the week. A bibliography in
proper citation format must be included at the bottom or on a final
panel. Minimum 250 words. See the google sheet tab with 'sample
assignments' for an example of a successful infographic.

Calculating participation:\
Q: Why do you do it this way? A: We use this structure to reduce
unconscious bias and subjective grading. Participation becomes
transparent and equitable because grades are based on clear, objective
evidence---not attendance, personality, or assumptions. Credit for
submissions require documented improvement and, for written work, direct
citation of weekly readings.

Q: What does it mean to calculate participation? A: Calculating
participation minimizes unconscious bias, groupthink, and subjective
grading. It creates a clear, fair structure for assessment. At the end
of the course, students self-calculate their participation based on what
they submitted each week. We only count your top 10 submissions. If
there are any exceptional circumstances, please document them in your
final attachment summary and explain how they impact your calculation. I
reserve the right to reassess any or all participation during the final
calculation.\
\
Sample calculation\
w1 85 - 'more precise'\
w2 85 - 'more precise'\
w3 85 -- 'too colloquial'\
w4 85 -- 'clarity needed'\
w5 85 - 'concluding bubble missing information'\
w6 0\
w7 85 - 'urls and conclusion need improvement'\
w8 85 'need for direct quotes'\
w9 70\
w10 90 -- 'ok\'\
w11 90- 'ok'\
w12 0\
7 weeks at 85 = 7x85 = 595\
2 weeks at 90 = 180\
1 week at 70 = 70

595+180+70 = 845 = 84.5%

## Attendance Bonus (5% on Final Exam ***or*** Essay -- whichever is 40%)

Students will receive a 1% bonus on their final exam or essay grade for
every two classes attended (attendance must be recorded through the
Microsoft form each week during class time), with a maximum of 10
classes considered to earn the full 5% bonus. You can check your
participation through the link in Brightspace weekly. You cannot receive
more than 100% on the final exam or essay.

## Term Assignment: 

### Option 1 -- Paired Debate 

Students must sign up on the link in OWL by the end of week 3 for the
debate or essay proposal or they forfeit their grade.

In teams of two ONLY, students should pick a specific issue to
decolonize related to their area of interest on Week one. The debate
should outline the key issues from two opposing sides and points of
contention and present each side coherently and convincingly to the
class.

The debate should likely be framed in reformist versus radical
strategies of decolonization.

The responses should attempt the decolonial strategies discussed in week
1, with clear academic Foundation. Each pair should try to convey the
perspective of the two sides as well as the actual outcome. MAXIMUM 5
MINUTES.\
The presentation should highlight:\
1. Key actors involved\
2. Relevant context or history related to the issue\
3. Claims and evidence put forward on both side\
4. Likely or actual outcome of the issue and the trajectory of the
relations moving forward

Students will need to upload their presentation in an accessible and
clear format (such as a series of tiktoks back and forth, youtube, etc)
for each week they sign up. Students must present on the week they sign
up or else they forfeit their grade. Students are encouraged to think
creatively about how they will present the debate and presentations may
take alternative formats as long as they accomplish the requirements
outlined above. In order to receive an individual mark, students must
upload a short (200 word) summary of their role in the debate
preparation and execution, assessing their groups' strengths and
weaknesses in OWL under 'Assignments'. If no individual summary is
included both students will receive the same mark .All written work must
use proper essay paragraph structure and conform to the 'criteria for
the evaluation of written assignments' below or it cannot achieve full
grades.

### Option 2 - Media Assessment

Due at the end of **Week 7.** This assignment will critically engage
with a movie or documentary that deals with decolonial politics. A list
of acceptable material is available on the course webpage, and all media
must have sufficient levels of academic-based argumentation from our
class to warrant its use. All media assessments must have prior approval
of the instructor and must be signed up on the course website at least 2
weeks before it is handed in. The media assessment must critically
engage with the content of the movie for its use in our understand of
the course material, as well as base arguments in academic research and
debates. You should assess the media for its arguments about
decolonization, and the viability of the arguments given the academic
debates on the issue. The assignment should be a minimum of 1000 words,
in proper essay format (with title page and bibliography) and have a
minimum of 4 academic sources, drawing primarily from course readings.
All written work must use proper essay paragraph structure and conform
to the 'criteria for the evaluation of written assignments' below or it
cannot achieve full grades.

## Option 3: Community Engaged Learning 

A few students will have the option of participating in a Community
Engaged Learning (CEL) opportunity with an offsite organization involved
in International legal issues. Students must submit an application
in-class for the opportunity to participate and will be graded on their
successful completion of their placement and a short reflective summary
that links their work with the CEL to class content. The reflection is
just about how you felt about it in the beginning, middle and end and
how your expectations changed over time. I am looking for reflection, if
you can link to course themes that would be great, but I am really
assessing reflection in general. It shouldn\'t be too long - I feel the
CEL placement is the bulk of the work, it is really just an expanded
version of the logs with some reflection on what happened, how your
expectations changed and what you would say to someone who wanted to do
it next year (i.e. 4-5 double spaced pages). All written work must use
proper essay paragraph structure and conform to the 'criteria for the
evaluation of written assignments' below or it cannot achieve full
grades.

## Essay 40% of final grade, due at the end of Week 10 

The final draft of the paper should be 8 pages (2000 words +/- 10%
strictly enforced) in length (excluding the bibliography) and must be
presented in proper scholarly format. The instructor may require that
10% of randomly selected students will have to meet to discuss their
paper after completion to ensure there has been no improper LLM use.

Students will write a major research paper (based primarily on academic
sources) on a topic of their choice, to be arrived at in consultation
with the instructor. Essay topics should be chosen by week 6. The essay
will choose a pre-approved topic and the required material(s) and
explicitly choose something to decolonize using Shilliam's
*recontextualize, reconceptualize, reimagine* framework. The assignment
must be in proper formal essay format (no bullet points, short form, or
colloquial language, can use subheadings to identify sections, use
proper citation, and should NOT INCLUDE ANY FORM OF ANNOTATED
BIBLIOGRAPHY). Dictionaries, encyclopedias, and Wikipedia should not be
used, and use of web material is subject to instructor's prior approval.
A basic structure for the essay will include:

1.  **Title, topic, and thesis question or area of interest for
    potential research.** Preapproved topics and approaches are here.

2.  **Something to decolonize** using Shilliam's *recontextualize,
    reconceptualize, reimagine* framework. The framework will provide
    the explanatory foundation of the thesis.

3.  **Three key distinct arguments with evidence in support of the
    thesis.** Remember to follow the paragraph structure in the course
    outline. The data should primarily come from course readings, the
    pre-approved suggested readings, and the suggested textbooks.
    Students must engage with at least four course texts to complete the
    assignment, and the majority of your academic sources should come
    from the required and optional readings in the course outline.

4.  **A conclusion that mirrors your title, topic, and thesis
    question.** It is always a good idea to rewrite your introduction
    after you have written your conclusion. Your conclusion should
    provide the clear foundation that you have established throughout
    the essay, to demonstrate the validity of your thesis. Therefore,
    your thesis and your conclusion should match one another. Failure to
    have consistent argumentation will result in the inability to
    achieve full grades.

5.  **Properly cited research.** In-text citation is preferred
    (author-date system, as outlined below in 'guidelines for success in
    class'). There should be no proxy urls (<https://www.lib.uwo.ca/>),
    no search urls (<http://search.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/>),
    or Dropbox urls (<https://www.dropbox.com/>). Citations need to be
    consistently formatted, readily available, in English, with precise
    page numbers (no inclusion of p.23-44, or consistent citation across
    pages (i.e. p.118-119). Lack of data is a lack of foundation. In the
    era of LLMs, inaccurate citations will be treated as no citation at
    all. LLMs routinely summarize sources without accessing the
    underlying data. Failure to directly quote sources with quotation
    marks followed by an explanation in your own words will constitute a
    lack of sufficient citation. Paraphrasing is no longer sufficient
    justification for including a citation; you must use specific and
    precise language, including nouns (specific people, places, and
    things), as generalized summaries of sources are often hallucinated,
    inaccurate, and incomplete when suggested by LLMs.

6.  **A title page** with your name, a title for your paper that
    reflects the thesis and topic of your paper, the date of submission,
    and the course number on it. If you cannot clearly and simply
    identify the title and topic of your paper, it is often an indicator
    of a lack of focus.

Papers submitted before the deadline can revise and resubmit the
assignment. For details on revision and resubmission see the 'revise and
resubmit' tab in OWL.

The Department's rules regarding plagiarism and the submission of
similar essays to two or more different instructors are appended to this
course outline and should be noted. (See 'Criteria for Evaluation of
Written Assignments' below). Students must submit their papers through
OWL and all papers may be processed by turnitin. Papers submitted after
deadlines (including excused late papers) will be marked, but comments
will not be provided.

## Final Exam : To be held online during the scheduled exam period.

20 or 40% of final course grade (depending on course options chosen).
For those who choose the essay or the exam is worth 20%. For those who
choose the weekly responses the final exam is worth 40%. To be scheduled
during the exam period. The final exam will be cumulative (i.e., will be
based on the material covered in lectures, assigned readings, and
discussions throughout the whole of the course). The exam may include
both a short answer/identification component and questions requiring
longer, essay-style responses. Choice of answers and an exam preparation
guide may be given.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Zoom Etiquette

1.  Please pay attention to video, microphone and screensharing
    settings. Keep chat rooms and images appropriate for an academic
    setting. Any inappropriate actions, imagery, discussion or chat
    messages may result in your removal from the meeting at my
    discretion. Audio recordings may be available as an alternative to
    synchronous discussion.

2.  Please test all WIFI, video and audio before the meetings. Zoom
    buttons for raising your hand, responding yes and no, asking host to
    adjust speed, requesting a break and more.

3.  Please be conscious of your speaking time and that of others, if you
    are continuing in a manner that is not fair to your peers, I reserve
    the right to intervene and put us back on a more focused discussion.

# Recording synchronous content (office hours or other meetings)

Any remote learning sessions for this course **may** be recorded. The
data captured during these recordings may include your image, voice
recordings, chat logs and personal identifiers (name displayed on the
screen). The recordings may be used for educational purposes related to
this course, including evaluations. The recordings may be disclosed to
other individuals participating in the course for their private or group
study purposes. Please contact the instructor if you have any concerns
related to session recordings. Participants in this course are not
permitted to record the sessions, except where recording is an approved
accommodation, or the participant has the prior written permission of
the instructor.

# Meeting the Requirements of the Assignment: 

All written work must be submitted on time, must be of the appropriate
length, must use the required number and type of resources, and, most
importantly, must address the issues or questions posed in the
assignment. All work must have sufficient academic content and sources
related to our course or else it cannot receive full marks.

# Non-medical and medical accommodation

Non-medical absences from class, late essays or assignments, will be
subject to a 10% penalty per day (weekends included). All assignments
must be completed to receive course credit. Further information is found
in the Policy on Accommodation for Medical Illness
(https://studentservices.uwo.ca/secure/index.cfm).

Accommodation for medical illness of work worth less than 10% of the
total course grade will require medical documentation. If documentation
is required for either medical or non-medical academic accommodation,
then such documentation must be submitted directly to the appropriate
Faculty Dean\`s office and [not]{.underline} to the instructor. Only the
Dean\`s office can determine if accommodation is warranted.

# Statement on Academic Offences

Scholastic offences are taken seriously and students are directed to
read the appropriate policy, specifically, the definition of what
constitutes a Scholastic Offence, at the following Web site:
http://www.uwo.ca/univsec/handbook/appeals/scholastic_discipline_undergrad.pdf
.

"All required papers may be subject to submission for textual similarity
review to the commercial plagiarism detection software under license to
the University for the detection of plagiarism. All papers submitted for
such checking will be included as source documents in the reference
database for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of papers subsequently
submitted to the system. Use of the service is subject to the licensing
agreement, currently between The University of Western Ontario and
Turnitin.com ( http://www.turnitin.com )."

## Guidelines for Success in Class

Since there seldom are definitive answers to the questions we will be
asking about decolonizing politics, and much of what you will learn in
this course will be enhanced by the ideas and perspectives of your
colleagues. But for this to work, everyone must participate fully and
constructively. Be mindful of the following points, and you will be
successful:

1.  • Come to all classes having read the assigned readings for that
    week and prepared to participate in discussion. It is useful to
    remember that some week's readings may be more relevant to your
    research interests than others and focusing on readings that are
    most salient to your interests will ensure maximum usefulness in the
    course.

    • Participate in discussions, but do not over-participate. Everyone
    must be given an opportunity to take part in discussions.
    Constructive participation involves the raising of *relevant* points
    and ideas. Online participation will be considered as well in
    participation marks.

    • Demonstrate respect for the ideas presented by others at all
    times. This is essential to open discussion and the free exchange of
    ideas. This does not mean that you must agree with others. Informal
    debate will teach you even more about your own position while
    simultaneously exposing you to different viewpoints. Make use of
    such opportunities, but no disrespectful behavior will be tolerated.

    • Raise questions when you have them. Raising useful questions
    counts as participation. You can use the online forums, e-mail,
    Facebook or zoom to raise questions you encounter throughout the
    course. Uncertainties are usually shared by others -- when you raise
    your questions in class everyone learns while you build your own
    participation grade. The forums should be the primary location for
    questions, please only use the other options AFTER you have posted
    to the forum.

# Criteria for the evaluation of written assignments

## Quotations

Quotations longer than 4 lines should be indented. Try to avoid
quotations longer than 4 lines. Assume that I do not read an indented 4
line quotation and make sure the sentence immediately following the
quotation summarizes its significance to your argument in your own
words. Never include quotations or sources in your introduction or
conclusion, your introduction and conclusion should outline the paper
structure in your own words.

## Citations and Bibliography

In the era of LLMs, inaccurate citations will be treated as no citation
at all. LLMs routinely summarize sources, without accessing the
underlying data. A failure to directly quote sources with quotation
marks followed by an explanation in your own words will constitute a
lack of sufficient citation. Paraphrasing is no longer a sufficient
justification for including a citation, you must use specific and
precise including nouns (specific people, places and things) as
generalized summaries of sources are often hallucinated, inaccurate and
incomplete when suggested by LLMs.

We will use the author date system. It keeps footnotes and endnotes to a
minimum.

- Text references will be short with the Surname, Date and page number
  (i.e. Žižek 2002: 342).

- Use this formatting everywhere, including sources from our reading
  list and in the response papers and any written work.

- Works by the same author in the same year should be cited as Žižek
  2002a, Žižek2002b, etc.

- Et al. can be used by sources with three or more authors. The full
  list must be in the bibliography.

- If you have more than one source in the same sentence you just include
  them with a semi-colon in chronological order i.e (Žižek 2002: 345;
  D'Amelio 2018: 212; Swift 2020: 445)

## Bibliography (style: Modified Harvard) - no footnotes or endnotes are allowed for citation

> A bibliography must be included in all written work, it should include
> the complete details of the work and included an 'Accessed' date if it
> is an online source.

## Analytical Content and Paragraph structure:

Higher grades will be given to work that demonstrates the ability to
interpret, critically assess and develop insights of the material. To
determine whether or not your argument is analytical, ask yourself \"Am
I demonstrating to the reader my insights in an academic way?" If you
are simply summarizing or describing in detail phenomena, your work is
unlikely to have high analytical content.

> *Helpful signs you are not developing analytical content: Excessive
> quotes; beginning or ending a paragraph with a quote; short (fewer
> than 4 sentences) paragraphs; no sources in a long paragraph; lack of
> similar argument in introduction and conclusion.*

## Development of an Argument:

Higher grades will be given to work that has a clearly stated argument
and a set of logically developed and reasonably comprehensive points in
support of that argument. Academic arguments need not be personal
(though in certain instances they can be -- check with the instructor),
rather they demonstrate the logical progression of the position you are
developing. The key here is to attempt to convince your reader of the
soundness or feasibility of your argument. Nuanced arguments recognize
obvious criticisms and seek to address them logically. Consistency of an
argument throughout a paper is important.

> *Helpful signs your argument may be in trouble: Using the same author
> or quote more than a few times in successive paragraphs; your
> introduction and conclusion are not similar; you introduce material in
> the introduction and the conclusion that cannot be found elsewhere;
> you have quotes in your conclusion; your attempt to address obvious
> criticisms contradicts your thesis, you adopt multiple theoretical
> frameworks; you cannot find any sources that agree with your central
> claims.*

## Grammar, Spelling, and Style: 

Higher grades will be given to written work that is grammatically
correct and is clearly and accurately written, while lower grades will
be given to work that is difficult to read or understand due to
excessive grammatical and/or spelling errors.

> *While different approaches work for different people, it is
> recommended that you try the following every time you have a written
> assignment: after completing your assignment, put it away for a while
> (ideally, for a few days); when you pick it up again, read it
> carefully, slowly, and aloud (when we are familiar with a paper we
> tend to skim it during proof-reading, thereby missing errors -- so
> make sure you are reading it word for word). Mistakes in grammar may
> not always look wrong, but they usually sound wrong. If you need some
> help with writing style or grammar, there are many resources available
> on campus.*

## Revise and resubmit

## Everyone in all of my third and fourth year courses has one \'revise and resubmit\' on every written assignment. I do this as practice because that\'s how my papers and chapters are reviewed by editors, and it\'s a primary value of the university experience, editing and revising.

## Written assignments in this course are able to be revised and resubmitted once and once only.

## If you want to use this as a draft option, you can hand in your written assignment early.

## In most cases, you will want to revise and resubmit the substantial assignments first, such as an essay.

## For students submitting on time: I follow a first-in-first-out essay submission system. If you submit your essay on time, I will aspire to have it back as soon as possible, so you can revise and resubmit it as soon as possible.

##  For students submitting with an approved extension: it\'s less likely that you will get the essay back in time to revise it. Please keep that in mind. 

## Resubmission rules

##  1. Resubmissions can only result in a higher grade, as long as you track changes. **You must track changes.** If you do not track changes, I will have to re-mark your paper from scratch and your grade is no longer guaranteed to improve. We use the online version of Word - we can track changes with \--\'review\'-\> \'track changes\'\--\> \'track changes for everyone\'

##  2. You **must include a grade goal** for your revised paper. The grade goal lets me assess the extent to which you have taken my comments and feedback and made sufficient changes to achieve your grade goal.

##  3. **You will not receive a second set of comments** on the revisions, only a revised grade. This is standard practice in publishing as well (revisions are sufficient, and they publish or revisions are insufficient and they reject).

##  4. All resubmissions must be submitted before you take your exam for the course.

# General

All students must complete all course requirements. Failure to do so
(e.g., by not handing-in an assignment or by missing an examination
without due cause) will subject the student to the appropriate
University regulations. Students must also keep a duplicate copy of
their assignments.

## Policy on communication

The forums should be your primary place for questions, issues and
concerns with the course. I strive to be accessible and responsive to
student inquiries. However, repeated or persistent e-mails/texts/phone
calls will overload my capacity to respond to all students equally. As
such, I reserve the right to answer initial questions but forego
multiple responses or inquires for a 24hour cool-down period. I also may
take longer to respond to communications during non-working hours,
holidays, and weekends. I appreciate your understanding in this matter.

## Late Assignments - Formal Guidelines

Late papers will be accepted but will be subject to a late penalty of 10
per cent per day to a maximum of 5 days, after which they will not be
accepted and a mark of 0 will be recorded. In the interest of fairness
to all students, there will be no exceptions to this unless you have
arranged in advance for an extension. All extensions must be arranged in
advance of the day on which a paper is due**. Papers submitted after
deadlines (including excused late papers) will be marked, but comments
will not be** **provided.**

## Policy on Children in the classroom[^1] 

"It is my belief that if we want women in academia, that we should also
expect children to be present in some form. Currently, the university
does not have a formal policy on children in the classroom. The policy
described here is thus, a reflection of my own beliefs and commitments
to student, staff and faculty parents.

All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as is
necessary to support the breastfeeding relationship. Because not all
women can pump sufficient milk, and not all babies will take a bottle
reliably, I never want students to feel like they have to choose between
feeding their baby and continuing their education. You and your nursing
baby are welcome in class anytime.

For older children and babies, I understand that minor illnesses and
unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of
having to choose between missing class to stay home with a child and
leaving him or her with someone you or the child does not feel
comfortable with. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare
solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps
in care is perfectly acceptable.

I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment
that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in
parenting status.

In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit
close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and
is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until
their need has been met. Non-parents in the class, please reserve seats
near the door for your parenting classmates.

Finally, I understand that often the largest barrier to completing your
coursework once you become a parent is the tiredness many parents feel
in the evening once children have finally gone to sleep. The struggles
of balancing school, childcare and often another job are exhausting! I
hope that you will feel comfortable disclosing your student-parent
status to me. This is the first step in my being able to accommodate any
special needs that arise. While I maintain the same high expectations
for all student in my classes regardless of parenting status, I am happy
to problem solve with you in a way that makes you feel supported as you
strive for school-parenting balance. Thank you for the diversity you
bring to our classroom!"

## Policy on non-service animals in the classroom 

Western University established a [Pets and Therapy Animals policy in May
2020](https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/policies_procedures/section1/mapp156.pdf)
that limits the presence of pets in campus buildings. Service and
therapy animals are permitted inside all Western locations, in
accordance with accessibility policies, however animals for
companionship are not allowed.

## Religious/Cultural Observance 

Persons who have religious or cultural observances that coincide with
this class should let the instructor know in writing (by e-mail for
example) by Week 4. I strongly encourage you to honor your cultural and
religious holidays! However, if I do not hear from you by Week 4, I will
assume that you plan to attend all class meetings.

## Point of View

The readings, class lectures, and my comments in class will suggest a
particular point of view. This perspective is my own and does not have
to be yours! I encourage you to disagree with the ideas in the readings
and lectures as well as the perspectives of your colleagues in the
course. Please express yourself! A significant part of a university
education is learning about the complexity of various issues; therefore,
it is important that we listen and respect one another but we do not
have to agree. A richer discussion will occur when a variety of
perspectives are presented in class for discussion.

## Academic Sources

A key aspect of the university experience is developing your ability to
assess the validity of sources. Academic sources such as those found on
Google Scholar should be your primary source of arguments, ideas and
claims made in the course. While it may be appropriate to provide
anecdotal, non-academic, news, theories from outside the academy as data
points, all arguments must be situated in triangulated academic
research. By triangulation (you may see a ∆ on your assignments) this is
the idea that academic peer review provides a foundation for the
veracity of the claims being made. if you rely too heavily on one source
(i.e. that more than 3 footnotes in a row are from the same source) you
may be veering towards summary or plagiarism of that source as it lacks
proper verification from other academics who agree with those
assessments. Moreover, most sources have implicit or explicit
frameworks, understandings, biases which you may not be able to assess
without triangulation. While there is no explicit number of sources
required on assignments, you will be unable to achieve full marks if you
do not have academic arguments with academic sources. This is a standard
expectation of all assignments in this class.

## Discussion Guidelines[^2]

In our structured and unstructured discussions and dialogues, we also
will have many opportunities to explore some challenging, high-stakes
issues and increase our understandings of different perspectives. Our
conversations may not always be easy; we sometimes will make mistakes in
our speaking and our listening; sometimes we will need patience or
courage or imagination or any number of qualities in combination to
engage our texts, our classmates, and our own ideas and experiences.
Always we will need respect for others. Thus, an important secondary aim
of our course necessarily will be for us to increase our facility with
the sometimes-difficult conversations that arise inside issues of social
inequality as we deepen our understandings of multiple perspectives --
whatever our backgrounds, experiences, or positions.

## Policy on the use of LLMs (AI, ChatGPT, Bard, etc) in the classroom **^3^**

Unless otherwise noted during class activities, you may only use LLMs,
ChatGPT or any other Generative technology to *aid* or *nuance* your
thinking, communication, and learning; but not to *replace* or *subvert*
it. See the table below for some examples of allowable and non-allowable
uses of Generative technology in this class (NOTE: This is not an
exhaustive list of examples). Generative technology may be used to
assist in assessment throughout the course, if you wish to opt out of
the use of generative technology, please let me know.

How generative technology may be used in assessment:

1\. Pre-assessment - to provide structural or overall feedback before I
begin any grading.

2\. Applying rubric - using the rubric from the course outline to apply
to submitted assignments to assess the degree of compliance before or
during I complete any grading.

3\. During assessment - to double-check the veracity of claims being
made about your submission during my assessment of your material.

4\. Post assessment - to find additional examples or instances in your
submissions to assist in my feedback.

5\. Refining assessment - suggesting forms of constructive criticism,
actionable items, and overarching themes or issues to assist in your
assessment.

How generative technology will NOT be used in assessment:

No grades will be assigned solely with generative technology at any
point in this course. Assessment will always be done by the instructor
in accordance with the course outlines, because of the unpredictability
and unreliability of current generative technology.

No personal or individual identifiers will ever be included in the
assessment of material by any generative technology.
